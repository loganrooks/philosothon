# Philosothon: Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What exactly is a Philosothon?
A Philosothon adapts the hackathon format for philosophical inquiry. Instead of programming, teams collaborate on developing philosophical arguments and perspectives within a limited timeframe.

### Do I need to be a philosophy specialist to participate?
Not at all! We welcome students from any program with an interest in philosophy. The event is designed to be accessible to those with varying levels of philosophical background.

### How much time commitment is required?
The event runs from 8:30AM to late evening on Monday, April 7th, and from 10:30AM to 2PM on Tuesday, April 8th. You should be prepared to dedicate most of Monday to the event.

## Team Formation

### How are teams formed?
Teams are created based on the preferences you indicate when signing up. You can request specific teammates, indicate whether you prefer working with people with similar or different interests, and specify if you'd like to mentor or be mentored.

### What if I already know who I want to work with?
You can request specific teammates on the sign-up form. If they also request you, we'll do our best to place you together. However, to maintain the experimental nature of the event, we'll limit pre-formed teams to maximize new connections.

### I'm a first-year student. Will I be at a disadvantage?
Not at all. The team formation process is designed to create balanced teams. First-year students bring fresh perspectives that are valuable to philosophical discussion, and if you prefer, you can be paired with more experienced students who can provide guidance.

## Themes and Voting

### How is the theme selected?
When you sign up, you'll rank the potential themes in order of preference. We'll use a ranked choice voting system to determine the winning theme, which will be announced at the opening of the event.

### What if there's a tie between themes?
If there's a close result between two themes, we might present both themes as options, allowing teams to choose which they prefer to address. We won't use more than two themes to maintain focus.

### How is the workshop topic selected?
Similar to theme selection, you'll rank workshop topics when signing up. We weight these votes based on their relevance to the chosen theme(s), giving priority to workshop topics that will be most useful for participants working on the selected theme.

## Workshops and Participation

### How do the workshops work?
We have two workshops scheduled:
1. **Philosophy of Technology Workshop** (Monday, 12:00-1:00PM): All participants attend this workshop, which includes lunch.
2. **Pascal Quest Workshop** (Monday, 6:00-8:00PM): This is a specialized workshop with limited capacity (7-14 participants). Each team will select one representative to attend.

### Why can only one person per team attend the Pascal Quest Workshop?
The Pascal Quest Workshop works best with a smaller group of 7-14 people. To maintain this ideal range while ensuring all teams benefit, we ask each team to send one representative who can then share insights with their teammates afterward.

### How should teams handle the Pascal Quest Workshop?
While one team member attends the Pascal Quest Workshop, the rest of the team should continue working on the project. After the workshop, teams should schedule time for the representative to share what they learned and discuss how these insights might inform their project.

## Presentations and Judging

### What format should our presentation take?
Each team will give a 10-minute presentation to the panel of judges. You have creative freedom in how you structure this, but it should clearly present your philosophical argument. Your presentation will be accompanied by a written component with more detailed argumentation and references.

### Who are the judges?
The judges will primarily be graduate students in philosophy, with possible participation from faculty members. They are selected for their expertise relevant to the event themes.

### What criteria will be used for judging?
Presentations will be judged on philosophical rigor, creativity, clarity, and how effectively they engage with the chosen theme. The judges will be looking for well-reasoned arguments that demonstrate both philosophical understanding and original thinking.

## Academic Workload and Extensions

### I'm worried about balancing this with my coursework. Any advice?
We understand this concern! The event is designed to be intellectually stimulating but manageable. Many students find that the collaborative nature of the Philosothon format actually helps them develop ideas they can later incorporate into their coursework. That said, we recommend reaching out to your professors in advance if you have assignments due around the event dates.

### Should I ask my professors for extensions on assignments?
This is entirely up to you. If you have assignments due right after the Philosothon weekend and are concerned about completing them, requesting an extension is an option. We recommend doing this well in advance—ideally at least a week before the event.

### How should I approach my professor about an extension?
Be honest, professional, and specific. Explain that you're participating in an educational philosophy event that will enhance your philosophical thinking ability. Focus on how this experience connects to your academic development and the course material. We provide a template email below that you can customize.

### What if my professor denies my extension request?
That's perfectly okay and within their rights. In that case, you'll need to plan ahead to complete your coursework before or during the event. Many students bring laptops and use breaks between Philosothon activities to work on assignments. Remember that the Philosothon runs primarily on Monday with just presentations on Tuesday morning.

### Can I still participate if I can't get extensions?
Absolutely! Most sessions take place on Monday with just the presentations on Tuesday morning. You can use evenings and time before/after the event to work on assignments. The submission deadline is flexible—while it's officially 11:59PM Monday, teams can continue refining their work until their presentation time on Tuesday.

## Template for Extension Request

Below is a template email you can adapt when requesting an extension from your professor:

Subject: Request Regarding Assignment Due Date - Philosothon Participation

Dear Professor [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to inform you about an educational opportunity I've been selected to participate in and to request a brief extension on [assignment name] due on [current due date].

I've been invited to participate in the Philosophy of Technology Group's "Philosothon" on April 7-8, which is an intensive collaborative philosophy event at UofT where students work in teams to develop philosophical arguments on technology-related themes. The event includes workshops, structured discussions, and culminates in team presentations judged by philosophy graduate students and faculty.

Participation in this event would significantly enhance my philosophical thinking skills and complements the work we've been doing in [course name], particularly regarding [mention relevant course topics that connect to philosophy of technology]. The skills I'll develop—collaborative philosophical inquiry, presenting complex arguments, and engaging with diverse philosophical perspectives—will directly benefit my academic development.

Would it be possible to extend the deadline for [assignment name] from [current date] to [proposed date]? This would allow me to fully engage with both the Philosothon and complete a quality assignment for your course.

I understand if this isn't possible according to course policies. If an extension isn't feasible, I will plan accordingly to ensure I meet all deadlines.

Thank you for considering my request. I'm happy to provide any additional information about the Philosothon or discuss alternative arrangements.

Sincerely, [Your Name] [Student Number]
