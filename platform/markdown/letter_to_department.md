# **Philosophy Hackathon ("Philosothon") Trial Event Proposal**

Dear Department of Philosophy,

As the Tech and Society Liaison, I am writing to request your support for a trial "Philosothon" event, designed to test a new format for collaborative philosophical inquiry among University of Toronto students.

## **Executive Summary**

The Philosothon trial will bring together 15-30 philosophy students for an intensive day of collaborative philosophical inquiry focused on technology-related themes, culminating in team presentations. This smaller trial event aims to assess student interest, refine the format, and gather feedback for a potential larger event next academic year. With your modest support of $50 for refreshments, we can launch this experimental initiative that may address the unique challenges philosophy students face in building community.

## **Event Overview**

The Philosothon adapts the hackathon format to philosophical inquiry. Participants will engage in concentrated collaborative thinking to produce well-reasoned arguments on themes at the intersection of philosophy and technology. These might include "Minds and Machines: Consciousness Beyond the Human," "Digital Commons: Rethinking Property in Information Space," or "Algorithmic Governance," among others. The theme will be determined by participant vote and announced at the opening of the event. Teams will produce a 10-minute presentation and accompanying written component.

## **Detailed Schedule**

## **Event Details**

**Saturday, April 26:**
* 8:30AM: Sign-in and welcome
* 9:00AM: Opening remarks and theme announcement
* 12:00-1:00PM: Workshop #1
* 6:00-8:00PM: Workshop #2
* 11:59PM: Submission deadline

**Sunday, April 27:**
* 10:30AM-12:30PM: Team presentations
* 12:30-2:00PM: Discussion, feedback, and closing

**Location:** BA1230

## **Organizational Structure**

This trial event will be conducted through the Philosophy of Technology Group (PoTG) rather than the PCU, due to timing constraints and its experimental nature. If successful, we envision transitioning this to a full PCU-sponsored event earlier in the next academic year.

## **Team Formation and Inclusivity**

Teams will be formed through:

* Limited self-selected groups registering together
* Individual registrations matched based on interests and academic year
* Intentional pairing of upper and lower-year students to facilitate mentorship
* Consideration of students' philosophical interests and experience levels

Teams will be announced to participants by the Thursday before the event.

## **Educational Benefits**

This trial event offers several unique educational opportunities:

1. **Collaborative Philosophy**: Creates a structured environment for collaborative philosophical dialogueâ€”a rare opportunity compared to the isolated nature of traditional philosophy coursework.
2. **Applied Philosophical Thinking**: Workshops on technological topics provide opportunities to apply philosophical concepts to concrete examples.
3. **Interdisciplinary Exploration**: Bridges philosophical inquiry with technological questions.
4. **Cross-Level Mentorship**: Teams will include students from various academic years, fostering peer mentorship.
5. **Low-Stakes Creative Expression**: Provides students with an opportunity to develop and present original philosophical arguments in a supportive environment.

## **Assessment and Reporting**

As this is a trial event, assessment is particularly crucial. We will:

* Administer detailed participant feedback surveys
* Document philosophical outputs and presentation quality
* Track attendance and engagement metrics
* Identify specific challenges and opportunities for improvement

We commit to providing the department with a comprehensive post-event report detailing outcomes, learnings, and recommendations for future iterations.

## **Funding Request**

We respectfully request financial support of $50 to cover lunch for participants during the Pascal Quest workshop. This modest investment will help us test the viability of this innovative educational format.

## **Conclusion**

The Philosothon trial represents a small but meaningful step toward fostering collaborative philosophical inquiry while addressing the specific community-building challenges faced by philosophy students. With your support, we can experiment with a new format that has potential to strengthen both student engagement and interdisciplinary philosophical education at the University of Toronto.

Thank you for your consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this proposal further.

Sincerely,

Logan Rooks
