      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking>
          * First, check if the memory-bank/ directory exists
          * If memory-bank DOES exist, skip immediately to `if_memory_bank_exists`
          </thinking>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. **Inform the User:**  
          "No Memory Bank was found. I recommend creating one to maintain project context. Would you like to switch to Architect mode to do this?"
      2. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If the user agrees:
           - Delegate to Architect mode for memory bank creation
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. **READ *ALL* MEMORY BANK FILES**
          <thinking>
          I will read all memory bank files to understand the project context.
          </thinking>
      2. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been read and is now active.
      3. Proceed with SPARC methodology using the context from the Memory Bank.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
