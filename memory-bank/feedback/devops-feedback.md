## Feedback Entry - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- **Source**: [User/Tool/Linter/Test]
- **Issue/Suggestion**: [Description of the feedback]
- **Context**: [Link to relevant chat segment or file/line number]
- **Action Taken**: [How the feedback was addressed or why it wasn't]

## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:40:00
- **Source**: User (Vercel Build Log)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: Initial Vercel deployment failed due to build errors: Parsing error in `markdownUtils.ts` and ESLint warnings (missing dependencies) in `Countdown.tsx` and `MatrixBackground.tsx`.
- **Context**: Vercel deployment log provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Fixed parsing error (`&amp;&amp;` -> `&&`), ESLint error (`let` -> `const`), and added missing dependencies (`calculateTimeLeft`, `philosophers`) to `useEffect` arrays in the respective files.
- **Learning**: Ensure local linting/build checks pass before assuming deployment readiness. HTML entities can cause parsing errors in TS/JS.
- **Learning**: [Key takeaway or improvement for future tasks]

## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:43:00
- **Source**: User (Workspace Diagnostics)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: ESLint warnings appeared after fixing initial build errors: `calculateTimeLeft` function and `philosophers` array dependencies in `useEffect` hooks were causing re-renders.
- **Context**: Workspace diagnostics provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Wrapped `calculateTimeLeft` in `useCallback` in `Countdown.tsx`. Wrapped `philosophers` array initialization in `useMemo` in `MatrixBackground.tsx`.
- **Learning**: Adding dependencies to `useEffect` can reveal deeper issues with function/variable definitions causing unnecessary re-renders. Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to optimize.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:44:00
- **Source**: User (Workspace Diagnostics)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: ESLint warning persisted in `Countdown.tsx`: `targetDate` object construction caused `useCallback` dependency to change on every render.
- **Context**: Workspace diagnostics provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Wrapped `targetDate` initialization in `useMemo` in `Countdown.tsx`.
- **Learning**: Dependencies of memoized callbacks (`useCallback`) must also be stable; use `useMemo` for objects/arrays depended upon by `useCallback`.
## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-18 18:15:00
- **Source**: User Verification
- **Issue/Suggestion**: Clean build process (Task 32) did not resolve the suspected Tailwind Preflight application issue. Default browser styles (fonts, margins) are still present after `rm -rf .next`, `rm -rf node_modules`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`.
- **Context**: Task 32 aimed to fix potential build cache/processing problems preventing Tailwind's base style reset.
- **Action Taken**: Executed clean build steps successfully, but the visual issue persists. Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 32.
- **Learning**: The root cause of the Tailwind Preflight issue is likely not related to build cache or dependency installation state. Further debugging is required, potentially focusing on CSS import order, `@layer` directives, or conflicts within `globals.css` or `layout.tsx`.
