## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-25 01:33:28
- **Source**: User
- **Issue/Suggestion**: User denied the `git reset --hard 094a9e3` operation for the `feature/registration-v3.1-impl` branch revert task. User stated they had manually fixed the syntax errors in `RegistrationDialog.test.tsx` that prompted the revert request, making the reset unnecessary.
- **Context**: Task 'Revert to Previous Commit on feature/registration-v3.1-impl Branch'.
- **Action Taken**: Halted the revert task as requested. Preparing `attempt_completion` to report cancellation.
- **Learning**: User actions can supersede planned tasks. Always confirm the current state and necessity before proceeding with potentially destructive operations like `git reset --hard`.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-22 11:22:27
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - supabase db push)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: The `supabase db push` command initially failed with "Remote migration versions not found in local migrations directory." suggesting a history mismatch. Subsequent `db pull` also failed, suggesting the *new* local migration should be marked `applied`. The history was successfully repaired by running `supabase migration repair --status reverted 20250422113204` followed by `supabase migration repair --status applied 20250422151859`.
- **Context**: Attempting to apply migration `20250422151859_enable_rls_core_tables.sql`.
- **Action Taken**: Followed CLI repair suggestions sequentially, which resolved the history mismatch and allowed the subsequent `db push` to report the database as up-to-date.
- **Learning**: Supabase migration history can become desynchronized. The `migration repair` command is necessary, but the specific version and status (`reverted` vs `applied`) suggested by the CLI might need careful interpretation depending on whether the mismatch involves remote-only or local-only migrations.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-21 12:16:30
- **Source**: DevOps Verification Step
- **Issue/Suggestion**: The SSOT generation script (`platform/scripts/generate-registration.ts`), while running successfully and generating the correct *number* of questions (45), produced an incomplete `Question` interface in the output file `platform/src/app/register/data/registrationQuestions.ts`. It is missing the `hint`, `description`, and `validationRules` fields expected from the SSOT.
- **Context**: Task 'Re-run SSOT Code Generation Script & Verify Output (Attempt 2)', Step 5a verification.
- **Action Taken**: Invoked Early Return Clause. Did not commit the faulty generated files. Reported the issue via `attempt_completion`.
- **Learning**: The generation script needs further debugging to ensure all fields from the SSOT schema are correctly included in the generated interface definitions.



## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-20 05:30:43
- **Source**: User
- **Issue/Suggestion**: The `attempt_completion` message lacked sufficient detail.
- **Context**: After completing the 'Run Registration SSOT Generation Script (Attempt 2)' task.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged feedback. Will provide a more detailed completion summary adhering to the DevOps mode's structured format.
- **Learning**: Ensure `attempt_completion` messages follow the mode-specific structure (Summary, Files Affected, MB Updates, Status/Next Steps) and provide adequate detail.

## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-19 08:32:37
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - supabase db push)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: The `supabase db push` command failed *again* with the error "Cannot find project ref. Have you run supabase link?". This occurred despite the user confirming the project ref and the assumption that `supabase link` had been run previously. The linking does not appear to be effective in the execution environment.
- **Context**: Retry attempt for applying the `20250419121817_add_profile_trigger.sql` migration.
- **Action Taken**: Task halted as per Early Return Clause. Memory Bank updated. Reporting blockage via `attempt_completion`.
- **Learning**: Need to verify the *persistence* and *context* of the `supabase link` command. It might need to be run within the same terminal session or environment where subsequent commands like `db push` are executed, especially in containerized or ephemeral environments.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-19 08:24:18
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - supabase db push)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: The `supabase db push` command failed with the error "Cannot find project ref. Have you run supabase link?". This indicates the local Supabase CLI is not linked to a remote Supabase project, preventing the migration from being applied.
- **Context**: Attempting to apply the `20250419121817_add_profile_trigger.sql` migration.
- **Action Taken**: Task halted as per Early Return Clause. Memory Bank updated. `attempt_completion` will be used to report the issue and recommend next steps.
- **Learning**: Ensure Supabase CLI is linked to the target project (`supabase link`) before attempting database operations like `db push`.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-18 18:56:51
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - git status)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: Task 38 (Clean `main` Branch) failed. After creating `fix/tailwind-integration`, committing specified changes, and checking out `main`, `git status` shows `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` is still modified and unstaged. The `main` branch is not clean as expected.
- **Context**: Task 38 aimed to move all unstaged changes from `main` to a new branch. The `sparc.md` file was not part of the originally listed unstaged files intended to be moved.
- **Action Taken**: Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 38. Halting further actions.
- **Learning**: Need to ensure the initial `git status` accurately reflects *all* unstaged changes before attempting to move them. Unforeseen modifications can disrupt the process.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-18 18:15:00
- **Source**: User Verification
- **Issue/Suggestion**: Clean build process (Task 32) did not resolve the suspected Tailwind Preflight application issue. Default browser styles (fonts, margins) are still present after `rm -rf .next`, `rm -rf node_modules`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`.
- **Context**: Task 32 aimed to fix potential build cache/processing problems preventing Tailwind's base style reset.
- **Action Taken**: Executed clean build steps successfully, but the visual issue persists. Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 32.
- **Learning**: The root cause of the Tailwind Preflight issue is likely not related to build cache or dependency installation state. Further debugging is required, potentially focusing on CSS import order, `@layer` directives, or conflicts within `globals.css` or `layout.tsx`.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:44:00
- **Source**: User (Workspace Diagnostics)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: ESLint warning persisted in `Countdown.tsx`: `targetDate` object construction caused `useCallback` dependency to change on every render.
- **Context**: Workspace diagnostics provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Wrapped `targetDate` initialization in `useMemo` in `Countdown.tsx`.
- **Learning**: Dependencies of memoized callbacks (`useCallback`) must also be stable; use `useMemo` for objects/arrays depended upon by `useCallback`.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:43:00
- **Source**: User (Workspace Diagnostics)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: ESLint warnings appeared after fixing initial build errors: `calculateTimeLeft` function and `philosophers` array dependencies in `useEffect` hooks were causing re-renders.
- **Context**: Workspace diagnostics provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Wrapped `calculateTimeLeft` in `useCallback` in `Countdown.tsx`. Wrapped `philosophers` array initialization in `useMemo` in `MatrixBackground.tsx`.
- **Learning**: Adding dependencies to `useEffect` can reveal deeper issues with function/variable definitions causing unnecessary re-renders. Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to optimize.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:40:00
- **Source**: User (Vercel Build Log)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: Initial Vercel deployment failed due to build errors: Parsing error in `markdownUtils.ts` and ESLint warnings (missing dependencies) in `Countdown.tsx` and `MatrixBackground.tsx`.
- **Context**: Vercel deployment log provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Fixed parsing error (`&&` -> `&&`), ESLint error (`let` -> `const`), and added missing dependencies (`calculateTimeLeft`, `philosophers`) to `useEffect` arrays in the respective files.
- **Learning**: Ensure local linting/build checks pass before assuming deployment readiness. HTML entities can cause parsing errors in TS/JS.
## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-19 16:15:54
- **Source**: User Intervention
- **Issue/Suggestion**: User emphasized the need to strictly follow the Build -> Fix -> Build -> Commit -> Push workflow. I committed and pushed fixes after a successful local build, but without explicitly confirming that build success before the commit/push steps, leading to user frustration.
- **Context**: After fixing the final build error related to `event.ts` and running a successful local build.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged feedback. Will ensure local build success is confirmed *after each fix* and *before* staging/committing/pushing in the future.
- **Learning**: Explicitly confirm local build success after each fix attempt before proceeding to Git operations, even if the previous step was a successful build. Improve communication about the workflow steps.
## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-20 13:20:19
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - git push)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: The command `git push origin feature/architecture-v2` failed with `error: src refspec feature/architecture-v2 does not match any`. This likely indicates a mismatch between the provided local branch name and the expected remote branch name. The `git status` output suggested the remote is `origin/feat/architecture-v2`.
- **Context**: Attempting to push commit `e3514e4` containing upgraded theme descriptions.
- **Action Taken**: Will retry the push using the simpler `git push` command, which should push to the tracked upstream branch.
- **Learning**: Verify remote branch names carefully, especially when explicit push commands are used. `git status` often provides clues about the correct upstream branch name. The simpler `git push` command is often safer when an upstream branch is already tracked.
## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-25 20:29:18
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - npm install)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: `npm install --save-dev @xstate/test` failed with ERESOLVE error. The project has `xstate@5.19.2`, but `@xstate/test@0.5.1` requires a peer dependency of `xstate@^4.29.0`. These versions are incompatible.
- **Context**: Task 'Add @xstate/test Dependency (Attempt 2)'. Attempting to install the dependency in the `platform` workspace.
- **Action Taken**: Invoking Early Return Clause as per task instructions. Halted further actions (commit).
- **Learning**: Peer dependency conflicts must be resolved before installation can succeed. This might involve upgrading/downgrading dependencies or finding compatible versions.
