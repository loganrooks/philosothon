## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-19 08:32:37
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - supabase db push)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: The `supabase db push` command failed *again* with the error "Cannot find project ref. Have you run supabase link?". This occurred despite the user confirming the project ref and the assumption that `supabase link` had been run previously. The linking does not appear to be effective in the execution environment.
- **Context**: Retry attempt for applying the `20250419121817_add_profile_trigger.sql` migration.
- **Action Taken**: Task halted as per Early Return Clause. Memory Bank updated. Reporting blockage via `attempt_completion`.
- **Learning**: Need to verify the *persistence* and *context* of the `supabase link` command. It might need to be run within the same terminal session or environment where subsequent commands like `db push` are executed, especially in containerized or ephemeral environments.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-19 08:24:18
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - supabase db push)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: The `supabase db push` command failed with the error "Cannot find project ref. Have you run supabase link?". This indicates the local Supabase CLI is not linked to a remote Supabase project, preventing the migration from being applied.
- **Context**: Attempting to apply the `20250419121817_add_profile_trigger.sql` migration.
- **Action Taken**: Task halted as per Early Return Clause. Memory Bank updated. `attempt_completion` will be used to report the issue and recommend next steps.
- **Learning**: Ensure Supabase CLI is linked to the target project (`supabase link`) before attempting database operations like `db push`.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-18 18:56:51
- **Source**: Tool (`execute_command` - git status)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: Task 38 (Clean `main` Branch) failed. After creating `fix/tailwind-integration`, committing specified changes, and checking out `main`, `git status` shows `memory-bank/mode-specific/sparc.md` is still modified and unstaged. The `main` branch is not clean as expected.
- **Context**: Task 38 aimed to move all unstaged changes from `main` to a new branch. The `sparc.md` file was not part of the originally listed unstaged files intended to be moved.
- **Action Taken**: Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 38. Halting further actions.
- **Learning**: Need to ensure the initial `git status` accurately reflects *all* unstaged changes before attempting to move them. Unforeseen modifications can disrupt the process.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-18 18:15:00
- **Source**: User Verification
- **Issue/Suggestion**: Clean build process (Task 32) did not resolve the suspected Tailwind Preflight application issue. Default browser styles (fonts, margins) are still present after `rm -rf .next`, `rm -rf node_modules`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`.
- **Context**: Task 32 aimed to fix potential build cache/processing problems preventing Tailwind's base style reset.
- **Action Taken**: Executed clean build steps successfully, but the visual issue persists. Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 32.
- **Learning**: The root cause of the Tailwind Preflight issue is likely not related to build cache or dependency installation state. Further debugging is required, potentially focusing on CSS import order, `@layer` directives, or conflicts within `globals.css` or `layout.tsx`.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:44:00
- **Source**: User (Workspace Diagnostics)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: ESLint warning persisted in `Countdown.tsx`: `targetDate` object construction caused `useCallback` dependency to change on every render.
- **Context**: Workspace diagnostics provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Wrapped `targetDate` initialization in `useMemo` in `Countdown.tsx`.
- **Learning**: Dependencies of memoized callbacks (`useCallback`) must also be stable; use `useMemo` for objects/arrays depended upon by `useCallback`.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:43:00
- **Source**: User (Workspace Diagnostics)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: ESLint warnings appeared after fixing initial build errors: `calculateTimeLeft` function and `philosophers` array dependencies in `useEffect` hooks were causing re-renders.
- **Context**: Workspace diagnostics provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Wrapped `calculateTimeLeft` in `useCallback` in `Countdown.tsx`. Wrapped `philosophers` array initialization in `useMemo` in `MatrixBackground.tsx`.
- **Learning**: Adding dependencies to `useEffect` can reveal deeper issues with function/variable definitions causing unnecessary re-renders. Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to optimize.


## Feedback Entry - 2025-04-03 16:40:00
- **Source**: User (Vercel Build Log)
- **Issue/Suggestion**: Initial Vercel deployment failed due to build errors: Parsing error in `markdownUtils.ts` and ESLint warnings (missing dependencies) in `Countdown.tsx` and `MatrixBackground.tsx`.
- **Context**: Vercel deployment log provided by user.
- **Action Taken**: Fixed parsing error (`&&` -> `&&`), ESLint error (`let` -> `const`), and added missing dependencies (`calculateTimeLeft`, `philosophers`) to `useEffect` arrays in the respective files.
- **Learning**: Ensure local linting/build checks pass before assuming deployment readiness. HTML entities can cause parsing errors in TS/JS.
