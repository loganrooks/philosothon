# Code Mode Feedback Log

### Feedback: `toHaveStyle` Fails with Tailwind/JSDOM (Task 48) - 2025-04-18 19:43:00
- **Source**: Test Output (Task 48)
- **Issue**: Tests in `FormEmbed.test.tsx` using `toHaveStyle` failed to verify computed styles (`max-width`, `margin`, `width`) even after applying the correct Tailwind classes (`max-w-4xl`, `mx-auto`, `w-full`) to `FormEmbed.tsx`.
- **Analysis**: Confirms the limitation observed in Task 44. JSDOM does not reliably compute styles applied via Tailwind utility classes, making `toHaveStyle` unsuitable for this purpose in the current test environment.
- **Action**: Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 48. Recommend reverting tests to use `toHaveClass` or exploring integration testing for computed style verification.


### Feedback: Persistent Build Error - Unknown Utility Class `font-philosopher` - 2025-04-18 15:37:00
- **Source**: Build Output (Task 12)
- **Issue**: Build fails consistently with `Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class: font-philosopher` originating from `@apply font-philosopher;` in `globals.css`.
- **Attempts**: 
    1. Verified `tailwind.config.ts` key (`philosopher`) matches `globals.css` usage.
    2. Corrected `postcss.config.js` plugin name (`@tailwindcss/postcss`).
    3. Integrated font using `next/font/google` in `layout.tsx` + CSS variable in `tailwind.config.ts` (similar to other fonts).
- **Result**: All attempts failed with the same error. Configuration files appear correct. Root cause unclear (potential cache, dependency, or build process issue).
- **Action**: Invoking Early Return Clause. Recommend delegating to `debug` mode.


### Feedback: Context Window & Diff Tool Issues - 2025-04-01 21:24:00
- **Source**: User Feedback
- **Issue**: Context window became too full, leading to repeated failures with the `apply_diff` tool due to inability to track file changes accurately.
- **Action**: Update Memory Bank with current progress and use `attempt_completion` to reset context. Ensure `read_file` is used before `apply_diff` in the future, especially after potential interruptions or multiple edits.
