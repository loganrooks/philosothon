### [2025-04-20 16:15:12] User Feedback: Request for More Detail
- **Trigger**: User feedback ('EVEN MORE DETAIL') on the previous early return report.
- **Context**: The previous report summarized the state and test failures but lacked sufficient granularity for the user.
- **Action Taken**: Will provide a more detailed early return report including specific line numbers, debug log analysis, and a clearer explanation of the suspected root cause.
- **Rationale**: To give the user a comprehensive understanding of the debugging attempts and the reasons for invoking the early return clause.
- **Outcome**: Preparing enhanced report.
- **Follow-up**: None.


### [2025-04-20 16:12:57] Intervention: Context Window Limit & Persistent Test Failures
- **Trigger**: User intervention (`INTERVENTION! INTERVENTION! HOLY SHIT...`) due to excessive context size (82%) and repeated failures in `RegistrationForm.test.tsx`.
- **Context**: Task involved implementing V3 UI logic in `RegistrationForm.tsx` to pass existing tests. Multiple attempts to refactor state management (`authSubStep`), rendering logic, and test assertions failed to resolve errors related to prompt rendering (`/^> $/`) and duplicate element finding (`/Full Name:/i`, `/University Email Address:/i`) during the early auth flow simulation.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task execution per user instruction and EARLY RETURN CLAUSE.
- **Rationale**: The complexity of the component's state and potential timing issues within the test environment, combined with the large context window, made further iterative debugging unreliable and risked performance degradation.
- **Outcome**: Task stopped before completion. `RegistrationForm.tsx` contains the latest refactoring attempt, but tests still fail.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend delegating debugging to `debug` mode via `new_task` and potentially simplifying tests or using integration tests.


# Code Mode Feedback Log

### Feedback: `toHaveStyle` Fails with Tailwind/JSDOM (Task 48) - 2025-04-18 19:43:00
- **Source**: Test Output (Task 48)
- **Issue**: Tests in `FormEmbed.test.tsx` using `toHaveStyle` failed to verify computed styles (`max-width`, `margin`, `width`) even after applying the correct Tailwind classes (`max-w-4xl`, `mx-auto`, `w-full`) to `FormEmbed.tsx`.
- **Analysis**: Confirms the limitation observed in Task 44. JSDOM does not reliably compute styles applied via Tailwind utility classes, making `toHaveStyle` unsuitable for this purpose in the current test environment.
- **Action**: Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 48. Recommend reverting tests to use `toHaveClass` or exploring integration testing for computed style verification.


### Feedback: Persistent Build Error - Unknown Utility Class `font-philosopher` - 2025-04-18 15:37:00
- **Source**: Build Output (Task 12)
- **Issue**: Build fails consistently with `Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class: font-philosopher` originating from `@apply font-philosopher;` in `globals.css`.
- **Attempts**: 
    1. Verified `tailwind.config.ts` key (`philosopher`) matches `globals.css` usage.
    2. Corrected `postcss.config.js` plugin name (`@tailwindcss/postcss`).
    3. Integrated font using `next/font/google` in `layout.tsx` + CSS variable in `tailwind.config.ts` (similar to other fonts).
- **Result**: All attempts failed with the same error. Configuration files appear correct. Root cause unclear (potential cache, dependency, or build process issue).
- **Action**: Invoking Early Return Clause. Recommend delegating to `debug` mode.


### Feedback: Context Window & Diff Tool Issues - 2025-04-01 21:24:00
- **Source**: User Feedback
- **Issue**: Context window became too full, leading to repeated failures with the `apply_diff` tool due to inability to track file changes accurately.
- **Action**: Update Memory Bank with current progress and use `attempt_completion` to reset context. Ensure `read_file` is used before `apply_diff` in the future, especially after potential interruptions or multiple edits.
