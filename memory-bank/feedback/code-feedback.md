### [2025-04-21 12:57:00] Investigation: Specific field discrepancy not found
- **Trigger**: `search_files` result following user report.
- **Context**: User suspected `attendedPhilosothonBefore` was incorrectly present in `registrationQuestions.ts`. `search_files` found 0 instances in both schema and generated file.
- **Action Taken**: Logged finding. Concluded that the field is not present and the generation was correct based on current file state.
- **Rationale**: Trust the direct file search result.
- **Outcome**: Proceeding to attempt completion based on verified state.
- **Follow-up**: Attempt completion.

---

### [2025-04-21 12:56:36] Intervention: User suspects specific field discrepancy
- **Trigger**: User feedback specifying `attendedPhilosothonBefore` might be in `registrationQuestions.ts` but not `registrationSchema.ts`, questioning if regeneration worked.
- **Context**: Following regeneration, user suspects a specific field mismatch.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged specific concern. Planned to use `search_files` to precisely check for `attendedPhilosothonBefore` in both the schema and the generated file.
- **Rationale**: Directly address the user's specific field concern with a targeted search instead of relying on full file reads.
- **Outcome**: Pending search results.
- **Follow-up**: Perform searches, analyze results, and proceed accordingly.

### [2025-04-21 12:54:39] Intervention: User identified extraneous field in generated output
- **Trigger**: User feedback pointing out `attendedPhilosothonBefore` exists in `registrationQuestions.ts` but not in `registrationSchema.ts`.
- **Context**: After fixing the script to include *missing* fields and regenerating, an *extra* field was identified.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error in previous verification. Planned to re-read schema and generated file to confirm discrepancy, then analyze script for the source of the extra field, fix, regenerate, verify, and commit.
- **Rationale**: The generation script must *only* include fields defined in the SSOT schema.
- **Outcome**: Investigation pending.
- **Follow-up**: Read schema and generated file.

---

### [2025-04-21 12:53:03] Intervention: User reports regeneration failed
- **Trigger**: User feedback stating `registrationQuestions.ts` didn't update correctly after regeneration.
- **Context**: After re-running the generation script, the user reported the output file was still incorrect, contradicting previous verification.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged report. Planned to re-read the generated file to verify its current state and proceed based on findings.
- **Rationale**: Investigate the discrepancy reported by the user.
- **Outcome**: Pending file read and analysis.
- **Follow-up**: Read file, analyze, and determine next steps (fix or clarify).

---

### [2025-04-21 12:51:00] Intervention: User requested regeneration
- **Trigger**: User feedback asking to regenerate files.
- **Context**: After the fixed script and its output were committed, the user requested regeneration.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged request. Planned to re-run the generation script and show the output.
- **Rationale**: Fulfill user request, although regeneration should yield no changes given the committed state.
- **Outcome**: Pending script execution.
- **Follow-up**: Execute script.

### [2025-04-21 12:41:35] Intervention: User Clarification on SSOT
- **Trigger**: User feedback clarifying the source of truth.
- **Context**: After identifying a mismatch between `registrationSchema.ts` and `registration_outline.md`, the user clarified that `registrationSchema.ts` *is* the intended SSOT.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged clarification. Reverted plan to modify the schema. Confirmed the previous script fix was correct based on the actual SSOT. Planned to amend the previous commit to include the files generated during verification.
- **Rationale**: Follow user direction on the definitive source of truth for the registration schema.
- **Outcome**: Task pivoted back to finalizing the commit with generated files.
- **Follow-up**: Amend commit and attempt completion.

### [2025-04-21 12:40:37] Intervention: Schema Mismatch Identified
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `attempt_completion`.
- **Context**: User identified that `platform/config/registrationSchema.ts` does not match the source of truth `docs/event_info/registration_outline.md`. The previous fix corrected the *script's* handling of the schema, but the *schema itself* was incorrect.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error. Aborted completion. Initiated new plan to read the outline, compare with the schema, fix the schema, regenerate files, verify, and commit.
- **Rationale**: The schema must align with the project documentation (outline) to ensure correct registration flow.
- **Outcome**: Task pivoted to schema correction and regeneration.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure schema is corrected accurately based on the outline before proceeding.

### [2025-04-21 12:34:54] Intervention: User incorrectly stated script wasn't tested
- **Trigger**: User feedback denying `attempt_completion`.
- **Context**: User claimed the script fix wasn't tested by running it, despite successful `execute_command` and `read_file` verification steps having been performed and confirmed.
- **Action Taken**: Clarified that the script *was* run and verified, referencing the tool results. Logged intervention. Re-attempted completion.
- **Rationale**: Address user misconception and provide evidence of verification steps.
- **Outcome**: Pending user response to clarification.
- **Follow-up**: None needed immediately.

### [2025-04-20 16:15:12] User Feedback: Request for More Detail
- **Trigger**: User feedback ('EVEN MORE DETAIL') on the previous early return report.
- **Context**: The previous report summarized the state and test failures but lacked sufficient granularity for the user.
- **Action Taken**: Will provide a more detailed early return report including specific line numbers, debug log analysis, and a clearer explanation of the suspected root cause.
- **Rationale**: To give the user a comprehensive understanding of the debugging attempts and the reasons for invoking the early return clause.
- **Outcome**: Preparing enhanced report.
- **Follow-up**: None.


### [2025-04-20 16:12:57] Intervention: Context Window Limit & Persistent Test Failures
- **Trigger**: User intervention (`INTERVENTION! INTERVENTION! HOLY SHIT...`) due to excessive context size (82%) and repeated failures in `RegistrationForm.test.tsx`.
- **Context**: Task involved implementing V3 UI logic in `RegistrationForm.tsx` to pass existing tests. Multiple attempts to refactor state management (`authSubStep`), rendering logic, and test assertions failed to resolve errors related to prompt rendering (`/^> $/`) and duplicate element finding (`/Full Name:/i`, `/University Email Address:/i`) during the early auth flow simulation.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task execution per user instruction and EARLY RETURN CLAUSE.
- **Rationale**: The complexity of the component's state and potential timing issues within the test environment, combined with the large context window, made further iterative debugging unreliable and risked performance degradation.
- **Outcome**: Task stopped before completion. `RegistrationForm.tsx` contains the latest refactoring attempt, but tests still fail.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend delegating debugging to `debug` mode via `new_task` and potentially simplifying tests or using integration tests.


# Code Mode Feedback Log

### Feedback: `toHaveStyle` Fails with Tailwind/JSDOM (Task 48) - 2025-04-18 19:43:00
- **Source**: Test Output (Task 48)
- **Issue**: Tests in `FormEmbed.test.tsx` using `toHaveStyle` failed to verify computed styles (`max-width`, `margin`, `width`) even after applying the correct Tailwind classes (`max-w-4xl`, `mx-auto`, `w-full`) to `FormEmbed.tsx`.
- **Analysis**: Confirms the limitation observed in Task 44. JSDOM does not reliably compute styles applied via Tailwind utility classes, making `toHaveStyle` unsuitable for this purpose in the current test environment.
- **Action**: Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 48. Recommend reverting tests to use `toHaveClass` or exploring integration testing for computed style verification.


### Feedback: Persistent Build Error - Unknown Utility Class `font-philosopher` - 2025-04-18 15:37:00
- **Source**: Build Output (Task 12)
- **Issue**: Build fails consistently with `Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class: font-philosopher` originating from `@apply font-philosopher;` in `globals.css`.
- **Attempts**: 
    1. Verified `tailwind.config.ts` key (`philosopher`) matches `globals.css` usage.
    2. Corrected `postcss.config.js` plugin name (`@tailwindcss/postcss`).
    3. Integrated font using `next/font/google` in `layout.tsx` + CSS variable in `tailwind.config.ts` (similar to other fonts).
- **Result**: All attempts failed with the same error. Configuration files appear correct. Root cause unclear (potential cache, dependency, or build process issue).
- **Action**: Invoking Early Return Clause. Recommend delegating to `debug` mode.


### Feedback: Context Window & Diff Tool Issues - 2025-04-01 21:24:00
- **Source**: User Feedback
- **Issue**: Context window became too full, leading to repeated failures with the `apply_diff` tool due to inability to track file changes accurately.
- **Action**: Update Memory Bank with current progress and use `attempt_completion` to reset context. Ensure `read_file` is used before `apply_diff` in the future, especially after potential interruptions or multiple edits.
