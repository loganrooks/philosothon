### [2025-04-21 18:33:41] Intervention: Task Pivot - Simple Email Capture Placeholder
- **Trigger**: User explicit command after multiple failed attempts to fix `RegistrationForm.tsx`.
- **Context**: The refactored `RegistrationForm` continued to exhibit critical bugs. User requested abandoning fixes and implementing a simple placeholder on `/register` to collect emails for notification, allowing other branch changes to be deployed.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged user request. Abandoned `RegistrationForm` debugging. Planned to: 1) Create a simple client component (`InterestForm.tsx`) with email input/submit. 2) Create a server action (`logInterest`) to handle email submission (logging/basic save). 3) Update `register/page.tsx` to use `InterestForm`.
- **Rationale**: Prioritize creating a stable, deployable state for the `/register` page while deferring the complex registration form implementation.
- **Outcome**: Placeholder implementation pending.
- **Follow-up**: Create `InterestForm.tsx`, `logInterest` action, update `register/page.tsx`, commit.



### [2025-04-21 18:31:06] Intervention: Task Pivot - Placeholder for Registration
- **Trigger**: User explicit command after multiple failed attempts to fix `RegistrationForm.tsx`.
- **Context**: The refactored `RegistrationForm` continued to exhibit critical bugs (stuck flow, incorrect existing user check). User requested abandoning the current fixes and creating a stable placeholder page for deployment.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged user request. Skipped reverting the last commit. Planned to modify `platform/src/app/register/page.tsx` to display a placeholder message instead of rendering `RegistrationForm`.
- **Rationale**: Prioritize creating a deployable state for the branch over fixing the complex registration component immediately.
- **Outcome**: Placeholder implementation pending.
- **Follow-up**: Modify `register/page.tsx`, commit, and attempt completion.



### [2025-04-21 17:34:10] Intervention: Early Return Clause Invoked - Sign-up Flow & Email Check Strategy
- **Trigger**: User explicit command invoking Early Return Clause.
- **Context**: After applying fixes to check email existence early using a dummy password sign-in attempt, the user expressed concern about the reliability of this strategy and reported the flow still gets stuck after password confirmation.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task execution per user instruction and Early Return Clause. Planned to revert the dummy password check implementation and report the blocker.
- **Rationale**: The dummy password strategy is potentially unreliable and doesn't fully resolve the underlying state transition issues after password confirmation. A dedicated, reliable method for checking user existence pre-password is required.
- **Outcome**: Task stopped. Sign-up flow remains broken.
- **Follow-up**: Revert last commit. Use `attempt_completion` to summarize state and recommend investigation into reliable pre-signup email existence checks (e.g., dedicated server action, Supabase function) and debugging the post-password state transition.



### [2025-04-21 17:31:48] Intervention: Sign-up Flow Still Stuck & Existing User Check Timing
- **Trigger**: User feedback and screenshot after second round of fixes.
- **Context**: User ran `register new`. Issues persist: 1) Flow still gets stuck after entering password confirmation. 2) Existing user check happens *after* password creation, but user explicitly requests check *immediately* after email input, overriding spec. 3) Prompt indicator `[reg x/36]>` still shows during password entry.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged regressions and user override for email check timing. Planned to: 1) Modify email processing to call `signInWithPassword` (with dummy password) immediately after email input to check existence. 2) If user exists, show error and reset. If not, proceed to password. 3) Re-debug state transitions after password confirmation/`signUpUser` call. 4) Ensure prompt text logic removes `x/36` during password steps.
- **Rationale**: Current implementation doesn't meet user's requirement for early email check and still has bugs in state progression after password confirmation.
- **Outcome**: Fixes pending.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read relevant sections of `RegistrationForm.tsx` and apply fixes using `apply_diff`.



### [2025-04-21 17:30:48] Intervention: Sign-up Flow Still Broken (Existing User, Stuck Password, UX)
- **Trigger**: User feedback and screenshot after applying regression fixes.
- **Context**: User ran `register new`. Issues persist: 1) Existing user email (`logan.rooks@mail.utoronto.ca`) was not rejected as per spec. 2) Flow gets stuck after entering password confirmation (doesn't proceed or error out correctly). 3) UX issues: No explicit prompts for password/confirmation, prompt indicator doesn't change.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged regressions. Planned to: 1) Re-examine and fix the existing user check logic within the `signUpUser` result handler. 2) Debug state transitions after password confirmation and `signUpUser` call to prevent getting stuck. 3) Re-apply fixes for explicit password prompts and ensure `getPromptText` updates correctly.
- **Rationale**: Critical sign-up logic, including existing user handling and state progression after password confirmation, remains flawed.
- **Outcome**: Fixes pending.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read relevant sections of `RegistrationForm.tsx` and apply fixes using `apply_diff`.



### [2025-04-21 17:24:25] Intervention: Regressions in RegistrationForm V3.1 Sign-up Flow
- **Trigger**: User feedback and screenshot after fixes for previous regressions.
- **Context**: User ran `register new`. Issues observed: 1) Incomplete intro text displayed. 2) Existing user email (`logan.rooks@email.utoronto.ca`) was not rejected; flow proceeded incorrectly. 3) UX awkwardness: no prompt change or explicit prompt text for password/confirmation. 4) Flow gets stuck after entering password (doesn't proceed to confirmation or next step).
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged regressions. Planned to: 1) Fetch full intro text from `registration_outline.md` and update component. 2) Fix existing user check logic in `signUpUser` result handling. 3) Improve UX by adding specific prompts and prompt text changes for password steps. 4) Debug state transitions after password entry/confirmation and `signUpUser` call.
- **Rationale**: The refactor and subsequent fixes failed to correctly implement critical parts of the V3.1 sign-up flow, including existing user handling and state transitions.
- **Outcome**: Fixes pending.
- **Follow-up**: Read `registration_outline.md`, re-read relevant sections of `RegistrationForm.tsx`, apply fixes using `apply_diff`.



### [2025-04-21 17:02:50] Intervention: Infinite Loop Regression in RegistrationForm
- **Trigger**: User feedback and screenshot after applying fixes.
- **Context**: After attempting to fix boot sequence, command parsing, and help logic, running `register new` resulted in an infinite loop repeating the 'First Name' prompt and hint. The prompt also showed `[reg 1/45]>` indicating `TOTAL_QUESTIONS` might be incorrect.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged regression. Planned to re-verify file state and re-apply fixes for `TOTAL_QUESTIONS` and the question display `useEffect` dependency array.
- **Rationale**: The `useEffect` hook responsible for displaying questions likely still has `state.outputLines` in its dependency array, causing a loop when hints are added. The `TOTAL_QUESTIONS` constant might also be incorrect.
- **Outcome**: Fixes pending re-verification and re-application.
- **Follow-up**: Re-read relevant sections of `RegistrationForm.tsx` and use `apply_diff` again.



### [2025-04-21 15:46:11] Intervention: Early Return Clause Invoked (RegistrationForm.tsx Debug Loop)
- **Trigger**: User explicit command (`OMG YOU ARE REPEATING YOURSELF I INVOKE THE EARLY RETURN CLAUSE`).
- **Context**: Multiple attempts (5+) to fix bugs in `RegistrationForm.tsx` related to password flow, prompt display, state transitions, and profile creation resulted in regressions (double prompts, missing prompts, stuck flows) and repeated tool failures (`apply_diff`). User confirmed profile creation still fails and no confirmation email is received.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task execution per user instruction and Early Return Clause.
- **Rationale**: Iterative fixes proved ineffective and introduced new bugs. Deeper state management or component logic issues suspected. Tooling (`apply_diff`) failures hindered progress.
- **Outcome**: Task stopped. `RegistrationForm.tsx` likely contains regressions.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend committing current state to a debug branch and delegating to `debug` mode via `new_task` for focused state/logic analysis and Supabase email confirmation verification.


### [2025-04-21 1:04:18] Resolution: User confirms file content is correct after editor refresh
- **Trigger**: User confirmation after closing/reopening file.
- **Context**: After multiple checks indicated file content was correct but user saw discrepancies, user confirmed editor refresh resolved the issue.
- **Action Taken**: Logged resolution. Confirmed task completion.
- **Rationale**: Discrepancy was due to editor state, not incorrect file content or generation.
- **Outcome**: Task is confirmed complete.
- **Follow-up**: Proceed with `attempt_completion`.

### [2025-04-21 12:57:49] Intervention: User points to specific lines for discrepancy
- **Trigger**: User feedback specifying lines 180-190 in `registrationQuestions.ts` contain the unexpected field.
- **Context**: After `search_files` failed to find `attendedPhilosothonBefore`, the user directed attention to specific lines.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error in relying solely on previous search. Planned to read the specified lines directly.
- **Rationale**: Directly verify the user's claim by examining the exact lines mentioned.
- **Outcome**: Pending file read.
- **Follow-up**: Read lines 180-190 of the generated file.


---

### [2025-04-21 12:57:00] Investigation: Specific field discrepancy not found
- **Trigger**: `search_files` result following user report.
- **Context**: User suspected `attendedPhilosothonBefore` was incorrectly present in `registrationQuestions.ts`. `search_files` found 0 instances in both schema and generated file.
- **Action Taken**: Logged finding. Concluded that the field is not present and the generation was correct based on current file state.
- **Rationale**: Trust the direct file search result.
- **Outcome**: Proceeding to attempt completion based on verified state.
- **Follow-up**: Attempt completion.

---

### [2025-04-21 12:56:36] Intervention: User suspects specific field discrepancy
- **Trigger**: User feedback specifying `attendedPhilosothonBefore` might be in `registrationQuestions.ts` but not `registrationSchema.ts`, questioning if regeneration worked.
- **Context**: Following regeneration, user suspects a specific field mismatch.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged specific concern. Planned to use `search_files` to precisely check for `attendedPhilosothonBefore` in both the schema and the generated file.
- **Rationale**: Directly address the user's specific field concern with a targeted search instead of relying on full file reads.
- **Outcome**: Pending search results.
- **Follow-up**: Perform searches, analyze results, and proceed accordingly.


---

### [2025-04-21 12:54:39] Intervention: User identified extraneous field in generated output
- **Trigger**: User feedback pointing out `attendedPhilosothonBefore` exists in `registrationQuestions.ts` but not in `registrationSchema.ts`.
- **Context**: After fixing the script to include *missing* fields and regenerating, an *extra* field was identified.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error in previous verification. Planned to re-read schema and generated file to confirm discrepancy, then analyze script for the source of the extra field, fix, regenerate, verify, and commit.
- **Rationale**: The generation script must *only* include fields defined in the SSOT schema.
- **Outcome**: Investigation pending.
- **Follow-up**: Read schema and generated file.

---

### [2025-04-21 12:53:03] Intervention: User reports regeneration failed
- **Trigger**: User feedback stating `registrationQuestions.ts` didn't update correctly after regeneration.
- **Context**: After re-running the generation script, the user reported the output file was still incorrect, contradicting previous verification.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged report. Planned to re-read the generated file to verify its current state and proceed based on findings.
- **Rationale**: Investigate the discrepancy reported by the user.
- **Outcome**: Pending file read and analysis.
- **Follow-up**: Read file, analyze, and determine next steps (fix or clarify).

---

### [2025-04-21 12:51:00] Intervention: User requested regeneration
- **Trigger**: User feedback asking to regenerate files.
- **Context**: After the fixed script and its output were committed, the user requested regeneration.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged request. Planned to re-run the generation script and show the output.
- **Rationale**: Fulfill user request, although regeneration should yield no changes given the committed state.
- **Outcome**: Pending script execution.
- **Follow-up**: Execute script.


---

### [2025-04-21 12:41:35] Intervention: User Clarification on SSOT
- **Trigger**: User feedback clarifying the source of truth.
- **Context**: After identifying a mismatch between `registrationSchema.ts` and `registration_outline.md`, the user clarified that `registrationSchema.ts` *is* the intended SSOT.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged clarification. Reverted plan to modify the schema. Confirmed the previous script fix was correct based on the actual SSOT. Planned to amend the previous commit to include the files generated during verification.
- **Rationale**: Follow user direction on the definitive source of truth for the registration schema.
- **Outcome**: Task pivoted back to finalizing the commit with generated files.
- **Follow-up**: Amend commit and attempt completion.

### [2025-04-21 12:40:37] Intervention: Schema Mismatch Identified
- **Trigger**: User feedback after `attempt_completion`.
- **Context**: User identified that `platform/config/registrationSchema.ts` does not match the source of truth `docs/event_info/registration_outline.md`. The previous fix corrected the *script's* handling of the schema, but the *schema itself* was incorrect.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged error. Aborted completion. Initiated new plan to read the outline, compare with the schema, fix the schema, regenerate files, verify, and commit.
- **Rationale**: The schema must align with the project documentation (outline) to ensure correct registration flow.
- **Outcome**: Task pivoted to schema correction and regeneration.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure schema is corrected accurately based on the outline before proceeding.

### [2025-04-21 12:34:54] Intervention: User incorrectly stated script wasn't tested
- **Trigger**: User feedback denying `attempt_completion`.
- **Context**: User claimed the script fix wasn't tested by running it, despite successful `execute_command` and `read_file` verification steps having been performed and confirmed.
- **Action Taken**: Clarified that the script *was* run and verified, referencing the tool results. Logged intervention. Re-attempted completion.
- **Rationale**: Address user misconception and provide evidence of verification steps.
- **Outcome**: Pending user response to clarification.
- **Follow-up**: None needed immediately.

### [2025-04-20 16:15:12] User Feedback: Request for More Detail
- **Trigger**: User feedback ('EVEN MORE DETAIL') on the previous early return report.
- **Context**: The previous report summarized the state and test failures but lacked sufficient granularity for the user.
- **Action Taken**: Will provide a more detailed early return report including specific line numbers, debug log analysis, and a clearer explanation of the suspected root cause.
- **Rationale**: To give the user a comprehensive understanding of the debugging attempts and the reasons for invoking the early return clause.
- **Outcome**: Preparing enhanced report.
- **Follow-up**: None.


### [2025-04-20 16:12:57] Intervention: Context Window Limit & Persistent Test Failures
- **Trigger**: User intervention (`INTERVENTION! INTERVENTION! HOLY SHIT...`) due to excessive context size (82%) and repeated failures in `RegistrationForm.test.tsx`.
- **Context**: Task involved implementing V3 UI logic in `RegistrationForm.tsx` to pass existing tests. Multiple attempts to refactor state management (`authSubStep`), rendering logic, and test assertions failed to resolve errors related to prompt rendering (`/^> $/`) and duplicate element finding (`/Full Name:/i`, `/University Email Address:/i`) during the early auth flow simulation.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task execution per user instruction and EARLY RETURN CLAUSE.
- **Rationale**: The complexity of the component's state and potential timing issues within the test environment, combined with the large context window, made further iterative debugging unreliable and risked performance degradation.
- **Outcome**: Task stopped before completion. `RegistrationForm.tsx` contains the latest refactoring attempt, but tests still fail.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend delegating debugging to `debug` mode via `new_task` and potentially simplifying tests or using integration tests.


# Code Mode Feedback Log

### Feedback: `toHaveStyle` Fails with Tailwind/JSDOM (Task 48) - 2025-04-18 19:43:00
- **Source**: Test Output (Task 48)
- **Issue**: Tests in `FormEmbed.test.tsx` using `toHaveStyle` failed to verify computed styles (`max-width`, `margin`, `width`) even after applying the correct Tailwind classes (`max-w-4xl`, `mx-auto`, `w-full`) to `FormEmbed.tsx`.
- **Analysis**: Confirms the limitation observed in Task 44. JSDOM does not reliably compute styles applied via Tailwind utility classes, making `toHaveStyle` unsuitable for this purpose in the current test environment.
- **Action**: Invoking Early Return Clause for Task 48. Recommend reverting tests to use `toHaveClass` or exploring integration testing for computed style verification.


### Feedback: Persistent Build Error - Unknown Utility Class `font-philosopher` - 2025-04-18 15:37:00
- **Source**: Build Output (Task 12)
- **Issue**: Build fails consistently with `Error: Cannot apply unknown utility class: font-philosopher` originating from `@apply font-philosopher;` in `globals.css`.
- **Attempts**: 
    1. Verified `tailwind.config.ts` key (`philosopher`) matches `globals.css` usage.
    2. Corrected `postcss.config.js` plugin name (`@tailwindcss/postcss`).
    3. Integrated font using `next/font/google` in `layout.tsx` + CSS variable in `tailwind.config.ts` (similar to other fonts).
- **Result**: All attempts failed with the same error. Configuration files appear correct. Root cause unclear (potential cache, dependency, or build process issue).
- **Action**: Invoking Early Return Clause. Recommend delegating to `debug` mode.


### Feedback: Context Window & Diff Tool Issues - 2025-04-01 21:24:00
- **Source**: User Feedback
- **Issue**: Context window became too full, leading to repeated failures with the `apply_diff` tool due to inability to track file changes accurately.
- **Action**: Update Memory Bank with current progress and use `attempt_completion` to reset context. Ensure `read_file` is used before `apply_diff` in the future, especially after potential interruptions or multiple edits.
