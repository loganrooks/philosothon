### Feedback: Context Window & Diff Tool Issues - 2025-04-01 21:24:00
- **Source**: User Feedback
- **Issue**: Context window became too full, leading to repeated failures with the `apply_diff` tool due to inability to track file changes accurately.
- **Action**: Update Memory Bank with current progress and use `attempt_completion` to reset context. Ensure `read_file` is used before `apply_diff` in the future, especially after potential interruptions or multiple edits.
