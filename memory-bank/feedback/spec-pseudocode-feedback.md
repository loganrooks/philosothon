### Feedback Log Entry - 2025-04-24 16:20:42

*   **Task:** Update `docs/project_specifications_v3.md` based on holistic review.
*   **Source:** User Feedback on `attempt_completion` denial.
*   **Feedback:** "more detailed message".
*   **Context:** The initial completion message summarized the changes but lacked specific details about *which* parts of the document were modified.
*   **Action Taken:** Acknowledged feedback. Re-read the modified file (`docs/project_specifications_v3.md`) to prepare a more detailed completion message listing the specific updates.



### Feedback Log Entry - 2025-04-19 03:23:00

*   **Task:** 76 (Draft Project Specification v2)
*   **Source:** User Feedback on `attempt_completion` denial.
*   **Feedback:** "You barely asked me any clarifying questions".
*   **Context:** Task 76 instructions explicitly requested minimizing questions, asking only *once* if *core intent* was ambiguous, and marking implementation details as TBD. I followed these instructions, asking only one question about AI generation vs. manual assist for theme descriptions (which was also noted by the user as needing clarification).
*   **Action Taken:** Acknowledged feedback, explained adherence to original instructions, preparing to ask user if they now prefer more questions about TBD items.
### Feedback Log Entry - 2025-04-19 03:34:00

*   **Task:** 76 (Draft Project Specification v2)
*   **Source:** User Feedback on `attempt_completion` denial (2nd attempt).
*   **Feedback:** "A few things, I haven't decided whether to replace the embedded google form, that is a decision that needs to be made on the basis of the other requirements".
*   **Context:** The original Task 76 prompt included "(Built-in Registration): Replace Google Forms... [SPARC Note: Requirement = Built-in form replacing Google Forms...]". This was interpreted as a firm requirement. User feedback clarifies this is still a decision point (TBD) dependent on other requirements.
*   **Action Taken:** Acknowledged feedback. Preparing to modify `docs/project_specifications_v2.md` to list Registration Method (Built-in vs. Google Forms) as TBD/Decision Point, rather than a requirement. Will re-attempt completion after modification.
### Feedback Log Entry - 2025-04-19 03:43:00

*   **Task:** 76 (Draft Project Specification v2)
*   **Source:** User Feedback on `attempt_completion` denial (3rd attempt).
*   **Feedback:** User wants to explore the Gamification requirement (Sec 3.6) further, moving beyond the high-level "Cicada 3301-style" TBD. Provided specific thematic directions: philosophy focus, deep knowledge, scavenger hunt (books/site), eerie/uncanny tone ("abyss", "occult knowledge"), potential AI agent interaction (terminal? specific texts like posthumanism, accelerationism, Roko's Basilisk). Requested clarifying questions and brainstorming, potentially including a research prompt suggestion.
*   **Context:** This overrides the previous instruction to defer TBDs and requires expanding the gamification specification significantly.
*   **Action Taken:** Acknowledged feedback. Preparing to update `docs/project_specifications_v2.md` Section 3.6 with new thematic details and then ask clarifying questions about mechanics and AI integration.
### Feedback Log Entry - 2025-04-19 03:44:00

*   **Task:** 76 (Draft Project Specification v2)
*   **Source:** User Response to Clarifying Questions (Gamification).
*   **Feedback/Decisions:**
    *   Access: All visitors.
    *   Start: Hidden prompt on homepage.
    *   Clues: Mix of site riddles and external text references.
    *   AI Role (If used): Lore source.
    *   Goal: Narrative conclusion/insight.
*   **Context:** Clarifying TBD items in Gamification section (3.6) of spec v2.
*   **Action Taken:** Preparing to update `docs/project_specifications_v2.md` Section 3.6.4 and Section 5 (TBD list) with these decisions.
### Feedback Log Entry - 2025-04-19 03:48:00

*   **Task:** 76 (Draft Project Specification v2)
*   **Source:** User Feedback on `attempt_completion` denial (4th attempt).
*   **Feedback:** Refined gamification concept: Main entry point to AI terminal interaction should be *after* registration, allowing personalization (addressing user by name, referencing form data). Acknowledged this likely necessitates a built-in registration form. Still undecided on AI implementation (pre-coded responses vs. live AI w/ DB access via MCP).
*   **Context:** Further refinement of Gamification (Sec 3.6) and its impact on Registration (Sec 3.2).
*   **Action Taken:** Preparing to update `docs/project_specifications_v2.md` Sections 3.6, 3.2, and 5 to reflect post-registration AI start, personalization, implication for built-in form, and AI implementation TBD.
### Feedback Log Entry - 2025-04-19 03:51:00

*   **Task:** 76 (Draft Project Specification v2)
*   **Source:** User Feedback on `attempt_completion` denial (5th attempt).
*   **Feedback:** Expressed preference for a "live AI with database access" (via MCP server) for the gamification element, rather than pre-coded responses. Provided further thematic direction: eerie, uncanny, viral potential, inspired by "House of Leaves", incorporating occult, AGI, singularity themes alongside philosophy/tech.
*   **Context:** Refining the AI implementation approach within Gamification (Sec 3.6) and its implications.
*   **Action Taken:** Preparing to update `docs/project_specifications_v2.md` Sections 3.6, 3.2, and 5 to reflect the preference for a live AI, add new thematic details, and adjust TBDs.
