# Debug Mode Feedback Log

This file tracks feedback received specifically for the Debug mode's performance and actions.


### [2025-04-23 22:23:56] - User Intervention: Premature Log Removal Recommendation
- **Trigger**: User feedback/denial after `attempt_completion` during REG-TEST-STATE-INIT-001 logging task.
- **Context**: I recommended removing the added console logs immediately after diagnosing the specific test failure.
- **Action Taken (by me)**: Recommended log removal in the completion report.
- **Rationale (mine, incorrect)**: Assumed the logs were no longer needed as the specific test failure cause was identified.
- **Outcome**: User denied completion, correctly pointing out the logs might be useful for debugging other potential initialization failures related to the broader REG-TEST-STATE-INIT-001 issue.
- **Follow-up**: Acknowledged feedback. Will revise the completion report to recommend keeping the logs until the broader issue is confirmed resolved.

### [2025-04-23 22:18:25] - User Intervention: Failure to Check Diffs & Log Intervention
- **Trigger**: User feedback/denial after `git stash` attempt during REG-TEST-STATE-INIT-001 debugging.
- **Context**: Preparing to add logging to `RegistrationDialog.tsx`, encountered unstaged changes from previous debug attempts.
- **Action Taken (by me)**: Attempted `git stash` without inspecting changes via `git diff`.
- **Rationale (mine, incorrect)**: Assumed changes were irrelevant leftovers.
- **Outcome**: User denied operation, correctly stating diffs must be checked. User also noted my failure to log interventions per rules.
- **Follow-up**: Used `git diff` to inspect changes, decided to keep them as they represent the current failing state to be logged. Proceeded with `read_file`. Logging this intervention now.
- **Meta-Correction**: This log entry also records the failure to log this intervention immediately when it occurred.

### [2025-04-21 16:27:00] - Early Return: Persistent Registration Flow Bugs (REG-FLOW-STATE-001) - FINAL
- **Trigger**: User invoked Early Return Clause *again* due to multiple persistent critical bugs after further fix attempts.
- **Context**: Debugging `RegistrationForm.tsx` state logic, email confirmation, and flow control.
- **Observed Errors (User Feedback & Screenshot Analysis)**:
    1.  **Existing User Handling Failure:** Signup flow still incorrectly proceeds to 'Account created/Check email' even for existing accounts, instead of detecting the existing account and prompting sign-in/reset.
    2.  **Stuck Registration Flow / Incorrect Question Display:** After the confirmation step (`continue`), the prompt correctly updates to `[reg 3/45]>`, but the component incorrectly re-displays the 'University Email Address' label (Q3) multiple times (triple output observed) instead of advancing to and displaying the label for Q4.
    3.  **Question Index Not Incrementing:** The `currentQuestionIndex` state appears stuck at the index for Q3, preventing progression through the registration questions.
    4.  **Multiple Output Lines (Triple Prompt):** The question label ('University Email Address') is rendered three times consecutively after the confirmation step.
- **Action Taken**: Invoked Early Return Clause. Stopping task.
- **Rationale**: Fixes applied were insufficient to resolve complex state management and rendering issues. Component likely requires significant refactoring.
- **Outcome**: Task blocked. Component remains critically buggy and unusable.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend escalating to Architect/SPARC for component redesign/rewrite, or potentially assigning a dedicated task to implement robust state management (e.g., using a state machine library) before further debugging.

### [2025-04-21 16:26:00] - Early Return: Persistent Registration Flow Bugs (REG-FLOW-STATE-001) - CORRECTED

### [2025-04-20 02:49:00] - Early Return: Investigate Vitest/JSDOM Test Stalling Issue (REG-TEST-STALL-001)
- **Trigger**: Diagnosis complete, fix requires component refactor outside task scope.
- **Context**: Investigated reported test stalling. Found tests actually fail fast due to component's async `bootSequence` (`useEffect` + `setTimeout`) incompatibility with Vitest/JSDOM timing. Component doesn't reach 'main' mode state before assertions.
- **Action Taken**: Invoked Early Return Clause.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to task scope and Early Return Clause. Root cause identified, but fix requires component changes.
- **Outcome**: Diagnosis complete. Tests remain failing.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend refactoring `RegistrationForm.tsx` boot sequence for testability or using alternative testing methods (integration/E2E).


### [2025-04-19 23:24:00] - Early Return: Vitest Mocking Error Task
- **Trigger**: Completion of primary objective (fixing `ReferenceError` in `RegistrationForm.test.tsx`).
- **Context**: Tests now run but reveal underlying component logic errors (component stuck in boot sequence, not rendering expected prompt).
- **Action Taken**: Invoked Early Return Clause as debugging component logic is outside the scope of the original task focused on the Vitest mocking error.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to task scope and Early Return Clause.
- **Outcome**: Mocking error fixed. Component requires further debugging.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend new task for `code` or `debug` mode to address the component logic failures.
