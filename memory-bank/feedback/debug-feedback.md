# Debug Mode Feedback Log

This file tracks feedback received specifically for the Debug mode's performance and actions.

### [2025-04-20 02:49:00] - Early Return: Investigate Vitest/JSDOM Test Stalling Issue (REG-TEST-STALL-001)
- **Trigger**: Diagnosis complete, fix requires component refactor outside task scope.
- **Context**: Investigated reported test stalling. Found tests actually fail fast due to component's async `bootSequence` (`useEffect` + `setTimeout`) incompatibility with Vitest/JSDOM timing. Component doesn't reach 'main' mode state before assertions.
- **Action Taken**: Invoked Early Return Clause.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to task scope and Early Return Clause. Root cause identified, but fix requires component changes.
- **Outcome**: Diagnosis complete. Tests remain failing.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend refactoring `RegistrationForm.tsx` boot sequence for testability or using alternative testing methods (integration/E2E).


### [2025-04-19 23:24:00] - Early Return: Vitest Mocking Error Task
- **Trigger**: Completion of primary objective (fixing `ReferenceError` in `RegistrationForm.test.tsx`).
- **Context**: Tests now run but reveal underlying component logic errors (component stuck in boot sequence, not rendering expected prompt).
- **Action Taken**: Invoked Early Return Clause as debugging component logic is outside the scope of the original task focused on the Vitest mocking error.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to task scope and Early Return Clause.
- **Outcome**: Mocking error fixed. Component requires further debugging.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend new task for `code` or `debug` mode to address the component logic failures.
