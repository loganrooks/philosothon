## Review Findings & Recommendations
### Finding: SPARC/TDD - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: SPARC/TDD
- **Location/File(s)**: `memory-bank/globalContext.md`
- **Observation**: The 'Completed Tasks' list in `globalContext.md` inaccurately included Admin CRUD and Auth implementation, despite logs indicating the entire admin section was removed.
- **Recommendation**: Corrected the 'Completed Tasks' list to reflect the removal of the admin section. Maintain accuracy in Memory Bank logs, especially summary sections.
- **Severity/Priority**: Medium

### Finding: Documentation - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Location/File(s)**: `docs/project_specifications.md` vs `platform/src/app/admin`
- **Observation**: The MVP specification requires a simple Admin Interface, but the entire `/admin` directory was removed from the codebase to resolve build issues.
- **Recommendation**: Re-evaluate the MVP scope or prioritize fixing the build issues and re-implementing the required Admin functionality. Update `project_specifications.md` or create an ADR if the scope change is permanent.
- **Severity/Priority**: High

### Finding: Hygiene - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/themes/page.tsx`, `platform/src/app/workshops/page.tsx`, `platform/src/app/faq/page.tsx`
- **Observation**: Specified filter/search components (`FilterControls`, `TagFilter`, `SearchBar`) are commented out in the public page implementations.
- **Recommendation**: Implement or remove the commented-out filter/search components based on current requirements. Update specs if functionality is deferred.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low

### Finding: Integration - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: Integration
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/components/FormEmbed.tsx`
- **Observation**: The Google Form embed code is missing from the `FormEmbed` component, replaced by a placeholder.
- **Recommendation**: Obtain the Google Form embed code and integrate it into the `FormEmbed` component as required by the MVP specs.
- **Severity/Priority**: Medium

### Finding: Hygiene - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Observation**: A TODO comment exists regarding the full application of the 'Philosopher' font, suggesting potential incomplete implementation despite configuration.
- **Recommendation**: Verify if the 'Philosopher' font is correctly applied to all intended heading elements and remove the TODO comment.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low
