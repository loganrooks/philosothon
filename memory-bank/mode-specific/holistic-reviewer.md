### Finding: Documentation - [2025-04-24 14:52:49]
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Location/File(s)**: `docs/project_specifications_v2.md`, `docs/architecture/terminal_component_v1.md`, `docs/specs/p0_registration_spec.md`, `docs/project_specifications.md`
- **Observation**: These documents appear superseded by V3 specifications and architecture.
- **Recommendation**: Archive these files to reduce clutter and potential confusion.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low

### Finding: Code Hygiene - [2025-04-24 14:52:49]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/register/data/registrationQuestions.ts`
- **Observation**: The generated `FormDataStore` type uses `any` placeholders instead of specific types derived from the schema.
- **Recommendation**: Update the generation script (`scripts/generate-registration.ts`) to infer and use more specific types (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `string[]`, custom ranking type) in the generated `FormDataStore`.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low

### Finding: SPARC/TDD - [2025-04-24 14:52:49]
- **Category**: SPARC/TDD
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.test.tsx`
- **Observation**: Test suite is excessively long (>2100 lines), contains significant repetition, relies on timing workarounds (`REG-TEST-TIMING-001`), and has a history of instability. Some assertions are commented out or potentially inaccurate.
- **Recommendation**: Delegate refactoring to `tdd` or `optimizer` mode to improve clarity, reduce repetition, address fragility, investigate the 1 skipped test, and ensure assertions accurately reflect V3.1 requirements.
- **Severity/Priority**: High

### Finding: Integration - [2025-04-24 14:52:49]
- **Category**: Integration
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.tsx`
- **Observation**: Component lacks implementation for handling the `ranked-choice-numbered` input type required by the schema/outline.
- **Recommendation**: Implement the necessary logic in the component after the test suite is stabilized. Delegate to `code` or `tdd` mode.
- **Severity/Priority**: High

### Finding: Integration - [2025-04-24 14:52:49]
- **Category**: Integration
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.tsx`
- **Observation**: Incomplete implementation of the email confirmation flow (`awaiting_confirmation` state). Relies on placeholder/missing logic for `checkConfirmationStatus` and `resend` command.
- **Recommendation**: Implement the actual logic for checking confirmation status and handling the `resend` command. Delegate to `code` or `debug` mode.
- **Severity/Priority**: Medium

### Finding: Code Hygiene - [2025-04-24 14:52:49]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.tsx`
- **Observation**: Component exceeds the SPARC guideline of 500 lines (currently 643 lines).
- **Recommendation**: Refactor the component into smaller, more focused hooks or sub-components after implementing missing features and stabilizing tests. Delegate to `optimizer` mode.
- **Severity/Priority**: Medium


## Review Findings & Recommendations
### Finding: Integration/SPARC/TDD - [2025-04-24 11:57:11]
- **Category**: Integration/SPARC/TDD
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.test.tsx`
- **Observation**: Test suite for `RegistrationDialog` is unstable. **Verification Run:** 8 failed, 24 passed, 33 skipped (out of 65). **No syntax errors preventing execution were found**, contradicting recent MB logs. **Failure Analysis:** Most failures stem from incorrect/fragile assertions (e.g., expecting specific output lines, incorrect state transitions due to mock setup for confirmation flow) rather than critical component bugs (boolean validation failure is an exception). **Skipped Tests:** 33 skips are mostly `it.todo` placeholders aligning with remaining spec features. **Code Hygiene:** Significant duplication exists between `ranked-choice-numbered` and `ranking-numbered` test blocks (lines ~1423-1871). Tests also rely on timing workarounds (REG-TEST-TIMING-001).
- **Recommendation**: **Highest Priority:** Delegate fixing `RegistrationDialog.test.tsx` to `tdd` mode. Task: Correct the 8 failing test assertions, remove duplicated test block (lines ~1649-1871), address assertion fragility. Ensure 24 currently passing tests remain passing.
- **Severity/Priority**: High

### Finding: Integration - [2025-04-24 11:50:50]
- **Category**: Integration
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.tsx`
- **Observation**: Component lacks implementation for handling and validating the `ranked-choice-numbered` input type specified in `registrationSchema.ts` and `docs/event_info/registration_outline.md`.
- **Recommendation**: Implement `ranked-choice-numbered` logic in the component *after* the test suite is verified and stabilized. Delegate to `code` or `tdd` mode.
- **Severity/Priority**: Medium

### Finding: Integration - [2025-04-24 11:50:50]
- **Category**: Integration
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.tsx`
- **Observation**: Logic for checking email confirmation status (`checkConfirmationStatus`) and resending confirmation emails (`resendConfirmationEmail`) relies on placeholder functions or commented-out mocks. Real implementation is missing.
- **Recommendation**: Implement actual backend logic/integration for email confirmation checks and resends when required by the development phase. This is lower priority than fixing tests and core component logic.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low


### Finding: SPARC/TDD - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: SPARC/TDD
- **Location/File(s)**: `memory-bank/globalContext.md`
- **Observation**: The 'Completed Tasks' list in `globalContext.md` inaccurately included Admin CRUD and Auth implementation, despite logs indicating the entire admin section was removed.
- **Recommendation**: Corrected the 'Completed Tasks' list to reflect the removal of the admin section. Maintain accuracy in Memory Bank logs, especially summary sections.
- **Severity/Priority**: Medium

### Finding: Documentation - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Location/File(s)**: `docs/project_specifications.md` vs `platform/src/app/admin`
- **Observation**: The MVP specification requires a simple Admin Interface, but the entire `/admin` directory was removed from the codebase to resolve build issues.
- **Recommendation**: Re-evaluate the MVP scope or prioritize fixing the build issues and re-implementing the required Admin functionality. Update `project_specifications.md` or create an ADR if the scope change is permanent.
- **Severity/Priority**: High

### Finding: Hygiene - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/themes/page.tsx`, `platform/src/app/workshops/page.tsx`, `platform/src/app/faq/page.tsx`
- **Observation**: Specified filter/search components (`FilterControls`, `TagFilter`, `SearchBar`) are commented out in the public page implementations.
- **Recommendation**: Implement or remove the commented-out filter/search components based on current requirements. Update specs if functionality is deferred.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low

### Finding: Integration - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: Integration
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/components/FormEmbed.tsx`
- **Observation**: The Google Form embed code is missing from the `FormEmbed` component, replaced by a placeholder.
- **Recommendation**: Obtain the Google Form embed code and integrate it into the `FormEmbed` component as required by the MVP specs.
- **Severity/Priority**: Medium

### Finding: Hygiene - [2025-04-18 01:03:00]
- **Category**: Hygiene
- **Location/File(s)**: `platform/src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Observation**: A TODO comment exists regarding the full application of the 'Philosopher' font, suggesting potential incomplete implementation despite configuration.
- **Recommendation**: Verify if the 'Philosopher' font is correctly applied to all intended heading elements and remove the TODO comment.
- **Severity/Priority**: Low
