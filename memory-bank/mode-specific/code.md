### Implementation: Update FAQ Functionality - 2025-04-01 15:11:48
- **Approach**: Implemented the update functionality for FAQ items. Created a new Server Action `updateFaqItem` in `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`. This action accepts the FAQ item `id` (bound) and `FormData`, extracts and processes form fields (question, answer, category, display_order - parsing string to number/null), uses the Supabase server client to update the corresponding record in `faq_items` table matching the `id`, includes error handling, revalidates `/admin/faq` and `/admin/faq/[id]/edit` paths on success, and redirects back to `/admin/faq`. Verified that `FaqForm` (`platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`) already correctly handled the required `action` prop and included the hidden `id` input when `initialData` was present. Verified that the "Add New FAQ" page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`) correctly passes the `addFaqItem` action. Updated the "Edit FAQ Item" page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to import the `updateFaqItem` action, bind the `faqItem.id` to it, and pass the bound action to the `FaqForm` component. Corrected an initial TypeScript error related to the import path for the action in the edit page.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`: Added `updateFaqItem` Server Action.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Imported and bound `updateFaqItem`, passed it to `FaqForm`, corrected import path.
- **Notes**: The update functionality for FAQ items is now complete, utilizing Server Actions for data mutation and revalidation.


### Implementation: Edit FAQ Data Fetching & Form Population - 2025-04-01 15:06:46
- **Approach**: Modified the Edit FAQ page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to be an `async` component. It now uses the Supabase server client (`createClient`) to fetch the specific FAQ item data based on the `id` from the route parameters using `.eq('id', id).single()`. Implemented error handling using `try...catch` and `notFound()` from `next/navigation` if the item isn't found. Passed the fetched `faqItem` data as the `initialData` prop to the `FaqForm` component. Modified the `FaqForm` component (`platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`) to accept an optional `initialData` prop (defining the `FaqItem` type locally for now) and used the `defaultValue` attribute on each form input (`question`, `answer`, `category`, `display_order`) to pre-populate the form. Also added a hidden input for the `id` when `initialData` is present.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Modified for data fetching, error handling, and passing props.
  - `platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`: Modified to accept `initialData` prop, define type, set default values, and include hidden ID input.
- **Notes**: This completes the data fetching and form population for editing FAQ items. The form currently uses a placeholder action; a specific `updateFaqItem` server action is needed for the actual update functionality. The `FaqItem` type was defined locally in both files; consider consolidating into a shared types file.


### Implementation: Admin FAQ Edit/Delete Actions & Route - 2025-04-01 15:02:52
- **Approach**: Modified the Admin FAQ list page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`) to add Edit/Delete actions. Changed the 'Add New FAQ Item' button to a `next/link` pointing to `/admin/faq/new`. Added a proper 'Actions' column header. Ensured the 'Edit' link in each row points to the correct dynamic route (`/admin/faq/[id]/edit`). Kept the 'Delete' button as a placeholder. Created the directory structure (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/`) and a basic placeholder page component (`page.tsx`) for the Edit FAQ route.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`: Modified to add Actions header, Edit link, Delete button, and update Add New link.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Created placeholder edit page.
- **Notes**: The Edit link now routes correctly. Delete functionality and the Edit page implementation (data fetching, form) are pending.

### Implementation: Add FAQ Form Submission - 2025-04-01 14:58:38
- **Approach**: Implemented the form submission logic for adding new FAQ items. Created a Server Action `addFaqItem` in `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`. This action handles `FormData` extraction (including parsing `display_order` to number or null), inserts the data into the Supabase `faq_items` table using the server client, handles potential database errors, revalidates the `/admin/faq` path on success, and finally redirects back to the FAQ list page. Updated the `FaqForm` component (`platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`) to accept the `addFaqItem` action via a required `action` prop and bind it to the `<form>` element. Updated the "Add New FAQ" page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`) to import and pass the `addFaqItem` action to the form component. Fixed TypeScript errors related to prop types and import paths.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`: Created Server Action file.
  - `platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`: Modified to accept and use the `action` prop, corrected prop type definition.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`: Modified to import and pass the action, corrected import path.
- **Notes**: The core functionality for adding FAQ items via the form is now implemented using Next.js Server Actions. Error handling in the action currently logs to the console.

### Implementation: Add New FAQ Page & Form - 2025-04-01 14:53:07
- **Approach**: Created the basic structure for adding new FAQ items. Created a new client component `FaqForm.tsx` (`platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`) containing a form with input fields for `question` (textarea), `answer` (textarea), `category` (text, optional), and `display_order` (number, optional), styled with Tailwind CSS. Added a submit button. Included TODO comments for future type definitions and props (like `initialData`, `action`). Created a new server component page `AddNewFaqPage` (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`) which renders a heading and includes the `FaqForm` component. Included TODO comments for importing and passing a server action to the form.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`: Created new component.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`: Created new page.
- **Notes**: This sets up the UI for adding FAQ items. Form submission logic (Server Action) is not yet implemented.
### Implementation: Delete Workshop Functionality - 2025-04-01 14:49:36
- **Approach**: Implemented the delete flow for workshops. Added a `deleteWorkshop` Server Action to `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts` which accepts a workshop `id`, uses the Supabase server client to delete the corresponding record, handles errors, and revalidates the `/admin/workshops` path on success. Created a new Client Component `WorkshopActions` (`platform/src/components/WorkshopActions.tsx`) to encapsulate the Edit link and the Delete button. The Delete button is wrapped in a `<form>` whose `action` is bound to the `deleteWorkshop` server action with the specific `workshopId`. An `onSubmit` handler is added to the form which uses `window.confirm` to ask for user confirmation before allowing the form submission. Modified the Admin Workshops list page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx`) to import and use the `WorkshopActions` component, passing the `workshopId` as a prop, replacing the previous placeholder link/button.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`: Added `deleteWorkshop` function.
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopActions.tsx`: Created new Client Component.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx`: Imported and used `WorkshopActions` component.
- **Notes**: Delete functionality is now implemented with server-side logic via Server Actions and client-side confirmation. Error handling in the server action currently logs to the console.



### Implementation: Update Workshop Functionality - 2025-04-01 14:44:30
- **Approach**: Implemented the full update flow for workshops. Added the `updateWorkshop` Server Action to `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`, handling form data extraction (including parsing `relevant_themes` JSON and `max_capacity` number), Supabase update operation using `.match({ id })`, error handling, revalidation of relevant paths (`/admin/workshops`, `/admin/workshops/[id]/edit`), and redirect on success. Modified `WorkshopForm` (`platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`) to make the `action` prop required again (it was previously made optional). Updated the "Edit Workshop" page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to import `updateWorkshop`, bind the workshop `id` to it, and pass the bound action to `WorkshopForm`. Resolved TypeScript errors related to the required `action` prop and handling `unknown` type for fetched data by defining a local interface and using type assertion. Verified "Add New Workshop" page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`) still correctly passes the `addWorkshop` action.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`: Added `updateWorkshop` function.
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`: Made `action` prop required.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Imported, bound, and passed `updateWorkshop` action; added local interface and type assertion.
- **Notes**: The update functionality for workshops is now implemented using Server Actions. Type safety for fetched data relies on a local interface and assertion due to missing global DB types.



### Implementation: Admin Workshops Edit Route - 2025-04-01 14:31:47
- **Approach**: Created the directory structure (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/[id]/edit/`) and a basic placeholder page component (`page.tsx`) for the Edit Workshop route. The placeholder page includes a heading displaying the workshop ID and indicates where the workshop editing form will be placed. This was done in response to the task to add Edit/Delete actions, but the actions were already present in the list page.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Created placeholder edit page.
- **Notes**: The Edit link in the workshops list page (`/admin/workshops`) now correctly routes to this dynamic page. The page is a basic placeholder awaiting data fetching and form implementation.


### Implementation: Add Workshop Form Submission - 2025-04-01 14:28:41
- **Approach**: Implemented the form submission logic for adding new workshops. Created a Server Action `addWorkshop` in `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`. This action handles `FormData` extraction, parses the `relevant_themes` field from a JSON string (with error handling for invalid JSON), parses `max_capacity` to a number (handling invalid input), inserts the data into the Supabase `workshops` table, handles potential database errors, revalidates the `/admin/workshops` path on success, and finally redirects back to the workshops list page. Updated the `WorkshopForm` component (`platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`) to accept the `addWorkshop` action via props and bind it to the `<form>` element. Updated the "Add New Workshop" page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`) to import and pass the `addWorkshop` action to the form component. Resolved intermediate TypeScript/ESLint errors related to locating Supabase type definitions (used `unknown` as a fallback) and incorrect import paths.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`: Created Server Action file.
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`: Modified to accept and use the `action` prop.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`: Modified to import and pass the action.
- **Notes**: The core functionality for adding workshops via the form is now implemented using Next.js Server Actions. A temporary `unknown` type is used for Supabase data due to the missing `database.types.ts` file, which should be addressed later for better type safety.


### Implementation: Add New Workshop Page & Form - 2025-04-01 14:21:03
- **Approach**: Created the basic structure for adding new workshops. Created a new client component `WorkshopForm.tsx` (`platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`) containing a form with input fields for `title`, `description`, `relevant_themes` (textarea for JSONB), `facilitator` (optional), and `max_capacity` (optional), styled with Tailwind CSS. Added a submit button. Included TODO comments for future type definitions, props (like `initialData`, `action`), and state management. Created a new server component page `AddNewWorkshopPage` (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`) which renders a heading and includes the `WorkshopForm` component. Included TODO comments for importing and passing a server action to the form.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`: Created new component.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`: Created new page.
- **Notes**: This sets up the UI for adding workshops. Form submission logic (Server Action) is not yet implemented.


### Implementation: Delete Theme Functionality - 2025-04-01 14:17:07
- **Approach**: Implemented the delete flow for themes. Added a `deleteTheme` Server Action to `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts` which accepts a theme `id`, uses the Supabase server client to delete the corresponding record, handles errors, and revalidates the `/admin/themes` path on success. Created a new Client Component `ThemeActions` (`platform/src/components/ThemeActions.tsx`) to encapsulate the Edit link and the Delete button. The Delete button is wrapped in a `<form>` whose `action` is bound to the `deleteTheme` server action with the specific `themeId`. An `onSubmit` handler is added to the form which uses `window.confirm` to ask for user confirmation before allowing the form submission (and thus the server action execution) to proceed. Modified the Admin Themes list page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`) to import and use the `ThemeActions` component, passing the `themeId` as a prop.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`: Added `deleteTheme` function.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeActions.tsx`: Created new Client Component.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`: Imported and used `ThemeActions` component.
- **Notes**: Delete functionality is now implemented with server-side logic and client-side confirmation. Error handling in the server action currently logs to the console.


### Implementation: Update Theme Functionality - 2025-04-01 14:11:48
- **Approach**: Implemented the full update flow for themes. Created the `updateTheme` Server Action in `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`, handling form data, Supabase update, error logging, revalidation, and redirect. Modified `ThemeForm` (`platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`) to accept a generic `action` prop (matching the expected type for form actions), and added a hidden input field for the theme `id` when `initialData` is present. Updated the "Add New Theme" page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx`) to pass the `addTheme` action. Updated the "Edit Theme" page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to import `updateTheme`, bind the theme `id` to it using `.bind(null, theme.id)`, and pass the bound action to `ThemeForm`. Corrected TypeScript errors related to action prop types and import paths. Modified server actions to return `void` on error to satisfy form action type requirements, relying on console logs for error feedback for now.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`: Added `updateTheme` function, modified error returns in both actions.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Modified props interface (`action` type), added hidden `id` input, updated form `action` attribute.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx`: Imported `addTheme` and passed it to `ThemeForm`.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Imported `updateTheme`, bound `id`, passed bound action to `ThemeForm`, corrected import path.
- **Notes**: The update functionality is now implemented. Error handling in server actions currently relies on console logs; future improvement could involve returning status/messages to the form.

### Implementation: Edit Theme Page Data Fetching & Form Population - 2025-04-01 14:05:15
- **Approach**: Modified the Edit Theme page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to be an `async` component. It now uses the Supabase server client (`createClient`) to fetch the specific theme data based on the `id` from the route parameters. Implemented error handling using `try...catch` and used `notFound()` from `next/navigation` to render a 404 page if the theme isn't found. Passed the fetched `theme` data as the `initialData` prop to the `ThemeForm` component. Modified the `ThemeForm` component (`platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`) to accept an optional `initialData` prop of type `Theme`. Used the `defaultValue` attribute on each form input (`title`, `description`, `analytic_tradition`, `continental_tradition`) to pre-populate the form with the values from `initialData` if provided.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Modified for data fetching and passing props.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Modified to accept `initialData` prop and set default values.
- **Notes**: This completes the initial setup for editing themes. The form currently uses the `addTheme` server action; a separate `updateTheme` action will be needed for actual updates. The `Theme` type was defined locally in both files; consider consolidating into a shared types file.


### Implementation: Admin Themes Edit/Delete Actions & Route - 2025-04-01 14:00:36
- **Approach**: Modified the Admin Themes list page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`) to replace placeholder action icons with functional links/buttons. Added a `next/link` component for the "Edit" action, pointing to the dynamic route `/admin/themes/[id]/edit`. Added a placeholder `<button>` for the "Delete" action (functionality TBD). Created the necessary directory structure (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/`) and a basic placeholder page component (`page.tsx`) for the Edit Theme route. The placeholder page includes a heading and indicates where the theme editing form will be placed.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`: Modified to add Edit link and Delete button.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Created placeholder edit page.
- **Notes**: The Edit link now correctly routes to a dynamic page based on the theme ID. The Delete button is styled but has no functionality yet. The Edit page is a basic placeholder awaiting data fetching and form implementation.


### Implementation: Add Theme Form Submission (Server Action) - 2025-04-01 13:56:49
- **Approach**: Created a Server Action (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`) named `addTheme` to handle form submissions from `ThemeForm`. The action retrieves form data, performs basic validation, uses the Supabase server client to insert the new theme into the `themes` table, includes error handling, and upon successful insertion, revalidates the `/admin/themes` path and redirects the user back to the themes list page. Updated the `ThemeForm` component (`platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`) to import this action and assign it to the `<form>` element's `action` prop.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`: Created the Server Action file.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Modified to import and use the Server Action.
- **Notes**: This implements the core logic for adding new themes through the admin interface. Error handling in the action currently logs to the console; more user-facing feedback could be added later.


### Implementation: ThemeForm Component - 2025-04-01 13:53:00
- **Approach**: Created a new client component (`platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`) to handle theme creation/editing. Included input fields for `title` (text), `description` (textarea), `analytic_tradition` (textarea, optional), and `continental_tradition` (textarea, optional), styled with Tailwind CSS. Added a submit button. Included TODO comments for future implementation of state management and form submission logic (e.g., using Server Actions).
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Created the component.
- **Notes**: Marked as `'use client'`. Basic form structure without state or submission handling.

### Implementation: Add New Theme Page - 2025-04-01 13:53:00
- **Approach**: Created a new server component page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx`) for adding new themes. Rendered a heading ("Add New Theme") and imported/rendered the `ThemeForm` component. Included commented-out placeholder code and TODOs for implementing a Server Action to handle form submission.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx`: Created the page component.
- **Notes**: This page provides the UI for adding themes. Form submission logic is pending.

### Implementation: Admin Manage FAQ Page - 2025-04-01 13:49:19
- **Approach**: Created a new server component page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`) for managing FAQ items. Implemented server-side data fetching using the Supabase server client (`@/lib/supabase/server`) by awaiting `createClient()` and then calling `.from('faq_items').select('*').order('created_at', { ascending: false })`. Included error handling for the fetch operation. Rendered a basic page layout with a title, a placeholder "Add New FAQ Item" button, and an HTML table styled with Tailwind CSS to display the fetched FAQ items (question and answer). Handled the case where no FAQ items are found. Added placeholder action links/buttons (edit/delete) in the table. Fixed initial TypeScript error related to incorrect `await` usage for `createClient`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`: Created the page component.
- **Notes**: This page provides the basic structure for FAQ management. Actual add/edit/delete functionality is not yet implemented. The `FaqItem` interface was defined locally; consider moving to a shared types file if reused.


### Implementation: Admin Manage Workshops Page - 2025-04-01 13:45:37
- **Approach**: Created a new server component page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx`) for managing workshops. Implemented server-side data fetching using the Supabase server client (`@/lib/supabase/server`) by awaiting `createClient()` and then calling `.from('workshops').select('*')`. Included error handling for the fetch operation. Rendered a basic page layout with a title, a placeholder "Add New Workshop" button (linking to `/admin/workshops/new`), and an HTML table styled with Tailwind CSS to display the fetched workshops (title and description). Handled the case where no workshops are found. Added placeholder action buttons (edit/delete) in the table. Fixed initial TypeScript errors related to `any` types and incorrect `await` usage for `createClient`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx`: Created the page component.
- **Notes**: This page provides the basic structure for workshop management. Actual add/edit/delete functionality is not yet implemented. The `Workshop` interface was defined locally; consider moving to a shared types file if reused. Replaced `any` with `unknown` for JSONB and error types.


### Implementation: Admin Manage Themes Page - 2025-04-01 13:41:42
- **Approach**: Created a new server component page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`) for managing themes. Implemented server-side data fetching using the Supabase server client (`@/lib/supabase/server`) to retrieve all records from the `themes` table. Included error handling for the fetch operation. Rendered a basic page layout with a title, a placeholder "Add New Theme" button (linking to `/admin/themes/new`), and an HTML table styled with Tailwind CSS to display the fetched themes (title and description). Handled the case where no themes are found. Added placeholder action buttons (edit/delete) in the table. Corrected initial Supabase client usage based on `server.ts` implementation.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`: Created the page component.
- **Notes**: This page provides the basic structure for theme management. Actual add/edit/delete functionality is not yet implemented. The `Theme` interface was defined locally; consider moving to a shared types file if reused.


### Implementation: Admin Content Management Links - 2025-04-01 13:36:54
- **Approach**: Added navigation links for content management (Themes, Workshops, FAQ) to the Admin Dashboard UI. Used `next/link` components and styled them with Tailwind CSS within the `AdminDashboardClient.tsx` component.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/components/AdminDashboardClient.tsx`: Added `Link` import and JSX for navigation links.
- **Notes**: Links point to `/admin/themes`, `/admin/workshops`, and `/admin/faq`. Basic button styling applied.


### Implementation: Admin Dashboard UI Structure - 2025-04-01 13:03:25
- **Approach**: Updated existing admin page (`platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) to include more specific placeholders for content management links and registration data view (DataTable, StatusFilters) based on project specifications. Imported `next/link`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Added placeholder UI elements and links.
- **Notes**: Basic structure is in place. Next steps involve creating actual components/pages for these placeholders (e.g., DataTable, content management forms).

### Implementation: Admin Registrations Data Fetching - 2025-04-01 13:08:00
- **Approach**: Modified `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx` to use the Supabase server client (`createClient`) to fetch all records from the `registrations` table. Included basic error logging and passed the fetched data (or an empty array) to the DataTable placeholder.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Added data fetching logic and updated DataTable placeholder.
- **Notes**: Fetches all columns (`*`) for now. Error handling is basic (console log). Data is passed to a placeholder; actual `DataTable` component implementation is pending.


### Implementation: DataTable Component - 2025-04-01 13:14:45
- **Approach**: Created a new component `platform/src/components/DataTable.tsx` to display registration data. Defined a `Registration` interface based on the schema in `docs/project_specifications.md`. The component accepts `registrations` data as a prop, renders an HTML table with Tailwind CSS, displays key columns (`full_name`, `email`, `academic_year`, `program`, `status`), and handles empty data states. Addressed ESLint errors by replacing `any` with `Record<string, unknown>` for JSONB types.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/components/DataTable.tsx`: Created the component.
- **Notes**: This component provides a basic view of registration data. Future enhancements could include sorting, filtering (handled by a separate component), pagination, and more detailed display of JSONB fields.

### Implementation: Integrate DataTable in Admin Page - 2025-04-01 13:14:45
- **Approach**: Imported the newly created `DataTable` component into `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`. Replaced the placeholder div with the `<DataTable registrations={registrationData} />` component call, passing the fetched registration data.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Imported and used the `DataTable` component.
- **Notes**: The admin page now renders the actual data table instead of a placeholder.

### Implementation: StatusFilters Component - 2025-04-01 13:19:08
- **Approach**: Created a new component `platform/src/components/StatusFilters.tsx` to display filter buttons ('All', 'Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected') using Tailwind CSS for styling. Integrated this component into the Admin page (`platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) above the DataTable.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/components/StatusFilters.tsx`: Created the component. `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Imported and used the `StatusFilters` component.
- **Notes**: The filter buttons are currently non-functional (UI only). State management and filtering logic will be added later.


### Implementation: Admin Registration Client-Side Filtering - 2025-04-01 13:33:33
- **Approach**: Implemented client-side filtering for the registration table on the Admin page. Refactored the data display logic into a new client component (`AdminDashboardClient.tsx`) which takes initial data fetched by the server component (`admin/page.tsx`). The client component uses `useState` to manage the active filter ('All', 'Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected'). The `StatusFilters.tsx` component was updated to accept the current filter and a callback function (`onFilterChange`) as props, adding `onClick` handlers and active state styling to its buttons. The `AdminDashboardClient` filters the `initialRegistrations` based on the `currentFilter` state before passing the result to the `DataTable` component.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/AdminDashboardClient.tsx`: Created. Handles state, filtering logic, and renders `StatusFilters` and `DataTable`.
  - `platform/src/components/StatusFilters.tsx`: Modified to accept props (`currentFilter`, `onFilterChange`), added `onClick` handlers and active styling.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Modified to remain a Server Component, fetch initial data, and render `AdminDashboardClient` passing the data as props. Removed direct rendering of `StatusFilters` and `DataTable`.
- **Notes**: This separates server-side data fetching from client-side interactivity, following Next.js best practices. The `Registration` type was duplicated in `AdminDashboardClient.tsx`; consider moving it to a shared types file (`platform/src/lib/types.ts`?) if it's needed elsewhere.
