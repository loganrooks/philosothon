## Analysis/Comparison
### [2025-04-22 19:10:10] Schedule Implementation Comparison
- **Purpose**: Compare schedule implementation (DAL, Page, Display) with working examples (themes, faq, workshops) to identify reasons for schedule data not appearing.
- **Files Compared**:
    - DAL: `schedule.ts`, `themes.ts`, `faq.ts`, `workshops.ts`
    - Pages: `page.tsx`, `themes/page.tsx`, `faq/page.tsx`, `workshops/page.tsx`
    - Display: `ScheduleDisplay.tsx`, `ThemeCard.tsx`, `AccordionGroup.tsx`, `WorkshopCard.tsx`
- **Findings**:
    - **DAL:** Fetching patterns (`fetchSchedule`, `fetchThemes`, etc.) are highly consistent (use `createStaticSupabaseClient`, `select *`, similar return/error handling).
    - **Pages:** Fetching patterns (async Server Component calling DAL) are consistent. **Key Difference:** `ThemesPage`, `FaqPage`, `WorkshopsPage` explicitly handle errors/empty data in JSX. `Home` page (`page.tsx`) only logs errors and passes data (`scheduleItems ?? []`) to `ScheduleDisplay`.
    - **Display:** `ScheduleDisplay` explicitly checks for empty/null `items` and shows fallback. `ThemeCard`, `AccordionGroup`, `WorkshopCard` do not, relying on parent pages for empty state handling.
- **Hypothesis**: Initial hypothesis was that `fetchSchedule` returned an unexpected empty array due to subtle data/query issue or cache.
- **Resolution**: User confirmed the issue was resolved by clearing the cache (`rm -rf platform/.next`) and rebuilding. This confirms the cache/build inconsistency hypothesis.


### [2025-04-21 14:57:38] RegistrationForm.tsx Logic Fix (Attempt 2)
- **Purpose**: Fix double prompt and failure to advance after password confirmation.
- **Files**: `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` (Modified)
- **Status**: Implemented

### [2025-04-21 19:26:46] Fix: Duplicate Message in InterestFormPlaceholder
- **Purpose**: Prevent the initial message block from appearing twice when entering the 'interest_capture' mode.
- **Files**: `platform/src/app/register/components/InterestFormPlaceholder.tsx` (Modified)
- **Change**: Added a `useRef` flag (`initMessagesAdded`) to the component. The `useEffect` hook responsible for adding the initial messages now checks this flag and only proceeds if it's `false`, setting it to `true` afterwards.
- **Status**: Implemented.
- **Related Issue**: [MB Log 2025-04-21 07:16:45]


## Bug Fixes

### [2025-04-21 16:46:03] RegistrationForm.tsx V3.1 Refactor
- **Purpose**: Rewrite RegistrationForm to comply with V3.1 spec (`docs/specs/p0_registration_terminal_ui_spec_v2.md` @ `8062e37`), focusing on robust state management using `useReducer`.
- **Files**:
    - `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` (Rewritten)
    - `platform/src/app/auth/actions.ts` (Added `resendConfirmationEmail`)
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Dependencies**: `react`, `use-local-storage-state` (indirectly via hook), `@supabase/ssr`
- **API Surface**: Exports `RegistrationForm` component.
- **Tests**: Existing tests in `RegistrationForm.test.tsx` likely need significant updates to match the new implementation and V3.1 logic. Recommend TDD run.
- **Notes**: Addresses previous state management complexity noted in feedback ([MB Log 2025-04-21 15:46:11]). Implements early auth flow, existing user detection, `awaiting_confirmation` mode with `continue`/`resend` logic. Uses `useReducer` for state transitions. File size exceeds 500 lines; consider future refactor of reducer/UI.



### [2025-04-21 05:53:00] Registration Schema (SSOT)
- **Purpose**: Central definition for all registration questions, types, validation, and metadata.
- **Files**: `platform/config/registrationSchema.ts`

- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build compilation pass, Git push success)
- **Dependencies**: `zod`
- **API Surface**: None changed directly. Zod schema in `actions.ts` updated.
- **Tests**: Build verified (compilation/types pass). TDD tests recommended as next step.
- **Notes**: Updated `registrationSchema.ts` to match V3 spec (31 questions, new types `multi-select-numbered`, `ranking-numbered`). Fixed generation script (`generate-registration.ts`) to correctly handle `'use server'` directive, imports in `actions.ts`, and type definitions in `registrationQuestions.ts`. Ran script, verified generated files. Build fails during static generation due to unrelated dynamic route issues (`cookies()` usage), but compilation/types pass. Committed (f115aa5) and pushed.


### [2025-04-20 13:38:00] Dynamic Theme Page Update (Markdown Source)
- **Purpose**: Modify the dynamic theme detail page to fetch and render content from individual Markdown files instead of Supabase.
- **Files**: 
    - `platform/src/app/themes/[id]/page.tsx` (Modified)
    - `platform/src/app/themes/[id]/page.test.tsx` (Modified)
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass)
- **Dependencies**: `fs/promises`, `path`, `react-markdown`
- **API Surface**: None changed.
- **Tests**: Updated existing tests to mock `fs.readFile` and verify rendering based on file content or fallback.
- **Notes**: Component now reads `docs/event_info/themes/[id].md`. Parses content before/after `## Suggested Readings`. Falls back to `theme.description` from DB if file read fails. Basic theme info (title) still fetched from DB via DAL.


## Documentation Refactoring

### [2025-04-20 06:08:00] Split Theme Descriptions
- **Purpose**: Reorganize expanded theme descriptions from a single file into individual files per theme for better management.

- **Purpose**: Formalize the visual style for the minimalist hacker aesthetic.
- **Files**: `docs/style_guide.md` (Created)
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Notes**: Defines color palette (emphasizing `light-text`, restricting green text), typography (JetBrains Mono default, Philosopher headings), spacing, border style (no rounded corners), and common component examples (buttons, forms, cards, timeline) using Tailwind. Specifies `MatrixBackground` as the default background. Addresses inconsistencies like dark gray usage in forms. Refined based on feedback regarding text color usage over Matrix/translucent backgrounds.


### [2025-04-19 01:50:05] Component Update: Admin Dashboard Page (Task 75)
- **Purpose**: Create the missing dashboard page to resolve `/admin` 404 errors.
- **Files**: `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx` (Created)
- **Status**: Implemented (Placeholder content)
- **Dependencies**: `react`
- **API Surface**: New page route `/admin`.
- **Tests**: None added.
- **Notes**: Created with basic placeholder content as per Task 75 instructions.

### [2025-04-19 01:50:05] Configuration Update: Middleware Matcher (Task 75)

- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass)
- **Dependencies**: `@supabase/ssr`, `next/server`
- **API Surface**: New GET route `/auth/callback`.
- **Tests**: No specific tests added for this route handler itself.
- **Notes**: Handles extracting the `code` query parameter, calling `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession`, and redirecting to `/admin` on success or error (or `/admin/login` if no code). Fixed initial TS error by awaiting `createClient()`.


### [2025-04-19 00:56:32] Styling Fix: NavBar Mobile Dropdown Padding (Task 70 Follow-up)
- **Purpose**: Increase left spacing within the mobile navigation dropdown after user reported it looked "wonky" post-Task 70.
- **Files Modified**: `platform/src/components/NavBar.tsx` (Changed `p-4-md` to `px-6 py-4` on dropdown div).
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass). Awaiting user visual verification.
- **Notes**: Addresses visual feedback received after removing rounded corners.


### [2025-04-19 00:50:56] Styling Update: Remove Rounded Corners (Task 70)
- **Purpose**: Remove Tailwind rounded corner utility classes (e.g., `rounded`, `rounded-md`) for a sharper aesthetic.
- **Files Modified**: All `.tsx` files within `platform/src` (via `find` and `sed`).
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass). Awaiting user visual verification.
- **Notes**: Used `find src -name '*.tsx' -exec sed -i 's/ rounded\\(-\\w\\+\\)\\?\\b//g' {} +` command in `platform` directory.

### [2025-04-19 00:06:16] Styling Update: Set Default Font to Monospace (Task 67)
- **Purpose**: Apply `font-mono` (JetBrains Mono) as the default body font, correcting the previous application of 'Inter'.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `platform/src/app/layout.tsx`: Removed `inter.variable` and `inter.className`, added `font-mono` to `<body>` className.
    - `platform/src/app/layout.test.tsx`: Updated assertions to remove checks for Inter classes and add check for `font-mono`.
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass)
- **Notes**: Corrects the default body font to align with the desired hacker aesthetic.


### [2025-04-18 23:57:04] Styling Fix: Apply 'Inter' Font (Task 66)

    - `platform/src/app/globals.css`: Removed unused `:root` variables (`--font-sans`, `--font-mono`).
    - `platform/src/app/layout.test.tsx`: Updated test assertion from `font-mono` to `mock-inter-class`.
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass)
- **Notes**: Addresses issue identified in Task 65 where `font-mono` was overriding the intended 'Inter' font.


## Intervention Log
### [2025-04-20 2:05:00] Intervention: Build Failure - SSOT Script Errors
- **Trigger**: `npm run build` failed after running `npm run generate:reg`.
- **Context**: Multiple build failures occurred after updating the SSOT config and running the generation script.
- **Action Taken**: 
    1. Fixed duplicate import and `'use server'` placement in `actions.ts`.
    2. Fixed `QuestionDefinition` interface in `registrationSchema.ts` (missing `placeholder`).
    3. Fixed `QuestionType` definition in `generate-registration.ts`.
    4. Fixed import/directive handling logic in `ensureSchemaUsageInActions` function within `generate-registration.ts`.
    5. Fixed ESLint warnings in `generate-registration.ts`.
- **Rationale**: The generation script had several bugs causing build failures: incorrectly adding duplicate imports, misplacing `'use server'`, referencing a missing interface property (`placeholder`), not generating correct type definitions, and having flawed logic for updating `actions.ts`.
- **Outcome**: Build compilation and type checking now pass after fixing the script and config. Static generation still fails due to unrelated dynamic route issues.
- **Follow-up**: None needed for this specific issue. The unrelated build failures need separate investigation.

### [2025-04-19 01:50:05] Intervention: Task 75 Blocked - Build/Restart Failed
- **Trigger**: `execute_command` (`rm -rf .next && npm run dev`) terminated (`^C`).
- **Context**: Attempting clean build and restart after creating `admin/page.tsx` and refining middleware matcher to fix admin 404s.
- **Action Taken**: Invoked Early Return Clause. Updated Memory Bank.
- **Rationale**: Build/restart is a required step in the task and it failed to complete.
- **Outcome**: Task 75 blocked.
- **Follow-up**: Recommend investigating the reason for the command termination (user action? build error?) and retrying the command, or delegating to `debug` mode if a build error occurred.


### [2025-04-19 00:21:34] Intervention Fix: NavBar Visual Issues (Task 23)
- **Trigger**: User visual review (Intervention: [2025-04-19 00:18:51])
- **Context**: Mobile dropdown was aligned left and perceived as transparent.
- **Action Taken**: Modified `NavBar.tsx` dropdown `div` class: changed `left-0 right-0` to `right-0 w-48` for alignment, removed `shadow-lg` to ensure opacity.
- **Rationale**: Align dropdown with trigger button and ensure readability.
- **Outcome**: Build and tests passed. Awaiting user visual confirmation.
- **Follow-up**: Request user visual confirmation.


### [2025-04-19 00:18:51] Intervention: NavBar Visual Feedback (Task 23)
- **Trigger**: User visual review
- **Context**: After implementing the hanging dropdown in Task 23, user observed incorrect mobile menu alignment (left instead of right) and perceived background transparency.
- **Action Taken**: Will adjust Tailwind positioning classes (`left-0 right-0` to `right-0`) and verify background class (`bg-dark-base`) for opacity.
- **Rationale**: Align mobile dropdown with the trigger button and ensure readability against page content.
- **Outcome**: Pending code modification and verification.
- **Follow-up**: Request user visual confirmation after fix.

### [2025-04-18 23:03:24] Styling Update: Replace Dark Text Classes (Task 59)
- **Purpose**: Improve text readability on dark theme by replacing dark gray utility classes (`text-gray-600/700/800/900`) with a lighter alternative (`text-gray-300`).
- **Files Modified**:
    - `platform/src/components/StatusFilters.tsx`
    - `platform/src/components/Timeline.tsx`
    - `platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`
    - `platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`
    - `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`
    - `platform/src/app/about/page.tsx`
    - `platform/src/app/workshops/page.tsx`
    - `platform/src/app/themes/page.tsx`
    - `platform/src/app/register/page.tsx`
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass)
- **Notes**: Used `search_and_replace` tool iteratively on identified files. Build and tests passed without regressions.


### [2025-04-18 19:43:57] FormEmbed Responsive Styling (Task 48) - Blocked
- **Purpose**: Apply responsive styling (`max-w-4xl` container, `w-full` iframe) to `FormEmbed.tsx` and ensure tests pass.
- **Files Modified**: `platform/src/components/FormEmbed.tsx` (Applied `max-w-4xl` to container div).
- **Status**: Blocked
- **Notes**: Applied the correct Tailwind class (`max-w-4xl`) to the container div. However, the tests in `FormEmbed.test.tsx` (updated in Task 47 to use `toHaveStyle`) failed. This confirms the previously identified limitation where JSDOM cannot reliably compute styles applied via Tailwind utility classes. Invoking Early Return Clause.


### [2025-04-18 23:25:32] Styling Update: Minimal Hacker Aesthetic (Task 61)
- **Purpose**: Refactor UI for a consistent "minimal hacker/coder aesthetic" (fonts, colors, spacing, borders).
- **Files Modified**:
    - `platform/src/app/globals.css`: Added global link styles (`text-hacker-green`, hover).
    - `platform/src/components/Footer.tsx`: Changed border to `border-medium-gray`.
    - `platform/src/components/ContentBlock.tsx`: Changed border to `border-medium-gray`.
    - `platform/src/components/ThemeCard.tsx`: Changed borders to `border-medium-gray`.
    - `platform/src/components/WorkshopCard.tsx`: Changed borders to `border-medium-gray`.
    - `platform/src/components/AccordionGroup.tsx`: Changed borders to `border-medium-gray`.
    - `platform/src/app/about/page.tsx`: Updated `h1` border to `border-medium-gray`, updated `blockquote` styles (border, padding, text).
    - `platform/src/components/Timeline.tsx`: Updated colors (border, heading, dot, year) to use theme colors.
    - `platform/src/app/themes/page.tsx`: Updated `h1` border to `border-medium-gray`, removed explicit text color from intro paragraph.
    - `platform/src/app/workshops/page.tsx`: Updated `h1` border to `border-medium-gray`, removed explicit text color from intro paragraph.
    - `platform/src/app/faq/page.tsx`: Updated `h1` border to `border-medium-gray`.
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Notes**: Applied changes iteratively across key components and pages. Focused on consistent use of theme colors (`hacker-green`, `dark-base`, `light-text`, `medium-gray`) and `font-mono`. Used subtle gray borders for a minimal look. `NavBar` already aligned well.



### [2025-04-19 00:16:20] Component Refactor: NavBar (Task 23)
- **Purpose**: Refactor NavBar for responsive horizontal layout, hanging mobile dropdown, and hacker aesthetic.
- **Files Modified**: `platform/src/components/NavBar.tsx`
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass)
- **Dependencies**: `useState` (React)
- **API Surface**: None changed.
- **Tests**: Existing tests in `NavBar.test.tsx` passed.
- **Notes**: Implemented horizontal desktop links (`md:flex`), hanging absolute dropdown (`absolute`, `top-full`), `useState` for toggle, `font-philosopher` for logo, `font-mono` for links.


## Components Implemented
### [2025-04-18 21:37:26] Styling Update: Improve Readability via Prose (Task 58)
- **Purpose**: Ensure body text on pages like `/about` and `/themes` has sufficient contrast against the dark background.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `platform/src/components/ContentBlock.tsx`: Removed explicit `text-light-text` class from the `div` containing children, allowing `prose prose-invert` to handle text color correctly for the dark theme.
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass)
- **Notes**: Base styles in `globals.css` and `layout.tsx` already set light text. `ThemeCard.tsx` uses appropriate light colors. The issue was likely the explicit text color overriding `prose-invert` defaults. Relying on `prose-invert` is the correct approach.



### [2025-04-18 20:45:11] Configuration Update: Correct Typography Plugin Registration (Task 56)
- **Purpose**: Fix missing `prose` styles (Issue VISUAL-PROSE-001) by changing plugin registration method for Tailwind v4.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `platform/tailwind.config.ts`: Removed `typography` plugin import and entry from `plugins` array.
    - `platform/src/app/globals.css`: Added `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";` directive after `@import "tailwindcss";`.
- **Status**: Implemented & Build Running
- **Notes**: Changed registration from config file to CSS import as per Tailwind v4 documentation and Task 55 findings. Awaiting clean build completion and user verification.


### [2025-04-18 17:17:00] Styling Update: Apply `font-philosopher` Directly (Task 27)
- **Purpose**: Apply 'Philosopher' heading font directly via utility class to avoid build errors with global `@apply`.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `platform/src/components/EventHighlights.tsx` (h3)
    - `platform/src/components/ScheduleDisplay.tsx` (h3 x2)
    - `platform/src/app/about/page.tsx` (h1, updated color)
    - `platform/src/app/themes/page.tsx` (h1, updated color)
    - `platform/src/app/workshops/page.tsx` (h1, updated color)
    - `platform/src/app/faq/page.tsx` (h1, updated color)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/layout.tsx` (h2)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx` (h1)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx` (h1)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/edit/page.tsx` (h1)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx` (h1)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx` (h1)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/edit/page.tsx` (h1)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx` (h1)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx` (h1)
    - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/edit/page.tsx` (h1)
- **Status**: Implemented & Verified (Build/Test Pass)
- **Notes**: This approach avoids the PostCSS/Tailwind build issue encountered with `@apply` in `globals.css`. Also updated heading text color in public pages for consistency.



### [2025-04-18 15:10:00] Dynamic Theme Detail Pages (Task 9)
- **Purpose**: Create individual pages for each theme, accessible via a dynamic route, displaying detailed information fetched from Supabase.
- **Files**:
    - `platform/src/app/themes/[id]/page.tsx`: Created new dynamic route page. Fetches theme data based on `id` param using server client, handles `notFound`, renders theme details.
    - `platform/src/components/ThemeCard.tsx`: Updated to wrap the card content in a `<Link>` pointing to `/themes/[id]`.
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Dependencies**: None added.
- **API Surface**: None added.
- **Tests**: None added for this feature yet.

### Implementation: Apply 'Philosopher' Font Globally (Task 5) - 2025-04-18 07:26:24
- **Approach**: Verified 'Philosopher' font import in `globals.css` and configuration (`font-philosopher`) in `tailwind.config.ts`. Added a CSS rule within `@layer base` in `globals.css` to apply `font-philosopher` to all heading elements (`h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6`). Removed the corresponding TODO comment from `layout.tsx`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/globals.css`: Added `@layer base` rule for headings.
  - `platform/src/app/layout.tsx`: Removed TODO comment.
- **Notes**: Applied font globally as preferred. This ensures consistent heading styling across the site.


### Implementation: Google Form Embed Integration (Task 3) - 2025-04-18 06:54:14
- **Approach**: Replaced the placeholder div in `platform/src/components/FormEmbed.tsx` with the provided Google Form `<iframe>` code. Converted HTML attributes (`frameborder`, `marginheight`, `marginwidth`) to JSX syntax (`frameBorder`, `marginHeight`, `marginWidth`). Fixed resulting TypeScript errors by changing string values (`"0"`) to numeric expressions (`{0}`). Added a container div with basic responsive styling (`max-w-full`, `overflow-hidden`, `p-4`) and centered the iframe (`mx-auto`, `style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }}`).
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/FormEmbed.tsx`: Updated component content.
- **Notes**: The component now embeds the specified Google Form. The iframe retains its original height and width, but the container and inline style prevent overflow on smaller screens.
### Implementation: Proposal Page (Task 2) - 2025-04-18 05:53:00
- **Approach**: Created a new route `platform/src/app/proposal/page.tsx`. Used `fs` to read `markdown/proposal_to_students.md`. Installed `react-markdown`. Used `ContentBlock` component, passing the Markdown content wrapped in `<ReactMarkdown>` as children and providing a title. Added a link to `/proposal` in `NavBar.tsx`'s `navItems` array.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/proposal/page.tsx`: Created new page component.
  - `platform/src/components/NavBar.tsx`: Added navigation link.
  - `platform/package.json`: Added `react-markdown` dependency.
- **Notes**: Implemented the page using existing `ContentBlock` and `react-markdown` for rendering. Assumes `@tailwindcss/typography` (already installed) handles styling via `prose` class in `ContentBlock`.
### Implementation: Core Styling & Responsiveness Fixes - 2025-04-18 05:08:00
- **Approach**: Investigated Tailwind CSS configuration, global styles, layout, and key components based on user task. Corrected `postcss.config.js`. Removed conflicting global padding rules from `globals.css`. Simplified padding and removed redundant styles in `layout.tsx`. Implemented a responsive mobile menu pattern in `NavBar.tsx`. Adjusted padding and font sizes in `ContentBlock.tsx` and `Hero.tsx` for better responsiveness. Removed redundant padding in `page.tsx`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/postcss.config.js`: Corrected plugin configuration.
  - `platform/src/app/globals.css`: Removed conflicting global padding rules.
  - `platform/src/app/layout.tsx`: Simplified container padding, removed redundant inline style.
  - `platform/src/components/NavBar.tsx`: Added mobile menu, adjusted padding.
  - `platform/src/components/ContentBlock.tsx`: Added responsive padding and title font size.
  - `platform/src/app/page.tsx`: Removed redundant padding.
  - `platform/src/components/Hero.tsx`: Added responsive padding.
- **Notes**: Addressed fundamental styling conflicts and improved responsiveness across core layout and components. Encountered and resolved several JSX syntax errors caused by `apply_diff` tool, switching to `write_to_file` for complex component updates.


### Implementation: Fetch Philosophy Articles - 2025-04-17 23:24:00
- **Approach**: Used the `fetcher` MCP tool (`fetch_url`) sequentially to retrieve content for 5 specified philosophy articles from SpringerLink. After each successful fetch, used `ask_followup_question` to prompt the user to save the content to a Markdown file and confirm readiness for the next article.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: None (User manually saved files based on fetched content).
- **Notes**: Completed fetching for all 5 articles as requested. Articles fetched: Ryberg (Criminal Justice/AI), Rodilosso (Filter Bubbles), Lavazza/Vilaça (Human Extinction/AI), de Fine Licht (GenAI/Higher Ed), Balcerak Jackson (Immersive Experience/VR).


### Implementation: Dev Container Configuration Update - 2025-04-03 02:45:00
### Implementation: RAG Markdown Optimizer Script Debugging - 2025-04-17 23:29:00
- **Approach**: Investigated user report of script failure. Analyzed log file (`rag_optimizer_20250417_232628.log`) and example Markdown (`docs/philosophy/phil_and_tech_journal/KarkiKaisa_DigitalDistractionAttentionRegulationAndInequality.md`). Found that the script failed to detect the 'References' section (which was titled '## Notes') and the citation regex (`CITATION_PATTERN`) failed due to newline characters within the link title attribute (`"..."`). Updated `scripts/rag_markdown_optimizer.py` by adding a pattern for `## Notes` to `REFERENCE_SECTION_PATTERNS` and modifying `CITATION_PATTERN` to `re.compile(r"\(([^,]+),\s*\[(\d{4})\]\([^)]+\s+\"([\s\S]+?)\"\)\)")` to correctly handle multiline titles.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `scripts/rag_markdown_optimizer.py`: Updated regex patterns.
- **Notes**: The script should now correctly identify the end of the main content in files using `## Notes` and successfully simplify citations even with multiline titles.


- **Approach**: Updated `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to add the Roo Cline extension (`rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline`) to the `customizations.vscode.extensions` array. Introduced the `mounts` property to consolidate volume and bind mounts. Added a named volume mount (`vscode-server-state-${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}`) targeting `/home/node/.vscode-server` to persist VS Code server state. Moved the existing workspace bind mount definition into the `mounts` array. Removed the deprecated standalone `workspaceMount` property.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Applied the described changes.
- **Notes**: This configuration ensures the Roo Cline extension is available in the dev container and improves container rebuild times by persisting VS Code server state.



### Implementation: RAG Markdown Optimizer Script - 2025-04-17 23:01:00
- **Approach**: Implemented the Python script `scripts/rag_markdown_optimizer.py` based on the pseudocode and requirements defined in `memory-bank/mode-specific/spec-pseudocode.md`. The script uses `argparse` for command-line arguments (directory path), `os.walk` to find `.md` files, `re` for pattern matching and substitution (citations, footnotes), `logging` for detailed output to console and a timestamped file, and standard file I/O. It processes content before a detected "References" section and modifies files in-place.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `scripts/rag_markdown_optimizer.py`: Created the script.
- **Notes**: Implemented core logic as specified, including handling for different reference section patterns, file I/O errors, and summary reporting. Added check to avoid rewriting files if no changes were made.


## Implementation Notes
### Implementation: FAQ Formatting Refinement - 2025-04-02 11:58:00
- **Approach**: Addressed poor formatting on the FAQ page by adding specific CSS rules to `globals.css` to control padding and font-weight within the `AccordionGroup` component, overriding global styles in that context. This respects the user's established workaround for Tailwind utility class issues.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/globals.css`: Added specific rules for `.bg-dark-base details > summary` and `.bg-dark-base details > div` to set padding and font-weight.
- **Notes**: Acknowledged the underlying issue with Tailwind utilities not applying reliably and noted it as technical debt for later investigation.


### Implementation: UI Theme Overhaul Final Refinements (Matrix Spacing/Speed) - 2025-04-02 07:27:00
- **Approach**: Addressed final user feedback on the Matrix background effect. Increased vertical spacing multiplier for philosopher names in `MatrixBackground.tsx` to 2.5. Adjusted speed logic to use a very slow range (0.05-0.1) for binary rain under names, ensuring a noticeable difference.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/MatrixBackground.tsx`: Updated name character spacing and binary rain speed logic.
- **Notes**: Further iteration on Matrix effect parameters based on visual review.


### Implementation: UI Theme Overhaul Final Refinements - 2025-04-02 07:09:00
- **Approach**: Addressed final user feedback on the hacker theme. Refined `MatrixBackground.tsx` to use binary rain (dark green) and make philosopher names more prominent (bright green, slower column speed, spaced letters). Fixed syntax errors in `NavBar.tsx` caused by previous diff applications and ensured minimalist styling. Increased padding in the main layout container (`layout.tsx`).
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/MatrixBackground.tsx`: Updated character sets, colors, speed logic, and letter spacing for names.
  - `platform/src/components/NavBar.tsx`: Corrected JSX structure using `write_to_file`.
  - `platform/src/app/layout.tsx`: Increased padding in `<main>` element.
- **Notes**: This completes the theme overhaul, incorporating the Matrix background and addressing layout/styling feedback.


### Implementation: UI Theme Overhaul Revision & Matrix Background - 2025-04-02 06:58:00
- **Approach**: Revised the UI theme overhaul based on user feedback. Corrected base styles in `layout.tsx` to ensure dark background, light text, and monospaced font apply correctly. Redesigned `NavBar` for a minimalist hacker aesthetic. Created a new `MatrixBackground.tsx` component using HTML Canvas to render falling characters (alphanumeric + Katakana + philosopher names) with variable speeds and subtle opacity. Integrated `MatrixBackground` into `layout.tsx`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/layout.tsx`: Corrected base styles (bg, text, font), imported and rendered `MatrixBackground`.
  - `platform/src/components/NavBar.tsx`: Redesigned for minimalist hacker style.
  - `platform/src/components/MatrixBackground.tsx`: Created new component for background effect.
  - *Previously modified components (Hero, Countdown, etc.) were implicitly affected by base style changes.*
- **Notes**: Addresses feedback on incorrect colors, font, and NavBar style. Implements the requested Matrix background effect. Further refinement of component spacing might be needed after review.


### Implementation: UI Theme Overhaul (Hacker Style) - 2025-04-02 06:50:00
- **Approach**: Overhauled the UI theme to a minimalist, hacker-inspired green/black style. Defined a new color palette in `tailwind.config.ts`. Updated base styles in `globals.css`. Refactored Tailwind classes across major components (`NavBar`, `Footer`, `Hero`, `Countdown`, `EventHighlights`, `ScheduleDisplay`, `ThemeCard`, `WorkshopCard`, `AccordionGroup`, `ContentBlock`, `InstructionBlock`, `FormEmbed`) to use the new colors and improve padding/margins. Installed and configured `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin, applying `prose-invert` to relevant components for dark theme compatibility. Resolved React hydration error in `Countdown` component by delaying render of time values until client-side mount.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/tailwind.config.ts`: Added new color palette, added typography plugin.
  - `platform/src/app/globals.css`: Set base background/text colors, removed light/dark mode specifics.
  - `platform/src/components/NavBar.tsx`: Updated styles.
  - `platform/src/components/Footer.tsx`: Updated styles.
  - `platform/src/components/Hero.tsx`: Updated styles.
  - `platform/src/components/Countdown.tsx`: Updated styles, fixed hydration error.
  - `platform/src/components/EventHighlights.tsx`: Updated styles.
  - `platform/src/components/ScheduleDisplay.tsx`: Updated styles.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeCard.tsx`: Updated styles.
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopCard.tsx`: Updated styles.
  - `platform/src/components/AccordionGroup.tsx`: Updated styles.
  - `platform/src/components/ContentBlock.tsx`: Updated styles, added `prose-invert`.
  - `platform/src/components/InstructionBlock.tsx`: Updated styles, added `prose-invert`.
  - `platform/src/components/FormEmbed.tsx`: Updated placeholder styles.
  - `platform/src/app/page.tsx`: Added container padding.
  - `platform/package.json`: Added `@tailwindcss/typography` dev dependency.
- **Notes**: Core theme refactoring complete. Optional background effects (Matrix, philosopher images) were not implemented. Further typography adjustments within `prose` elements might be needed depending on specific content.


### Implementation: Functional Adjustments (Countdown, Schedule, Highlights) - 2025-04-02 06:29:00
- **Approach**: Implemented several functional adjustments as requested: updated the target date in `Countdown.tsx` to April 7, 2025, 9:00 AM; located the event schedule in `docs/event_info/letter_to_department.md`; created a new component `ScheduleDisplay.tsx` to render the extracted schedule; integrated `ScheduleDisplay` into the Home page (`app/page.tsx`); and removed the "Keynote Speaker" item from the `highlights` array in `EventHighlights.tsx`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/Countdown.tsx`: Modified target date.
  - `platform/src/components/ScheduleDisplay.tsx`: Created new component.
  - `platform/src/app/page.tsx`: Imported and rendered `ScheduleDisplay`.
  - `platform/src/components/EventHighlights.tsx`: Removed keynote highlight item.
- **Notes**: Completed all requested adjustments. The schedule is now displayed on the home page, the countdown timer is correct, and the event highlights are updated.

### Implementation: Admin Authentication Flow (Magic Link) - 2025-04-01 23:11:00
- **Approach**: Implemented the admin login flow using Supabase Auth's `signInWithOtp` (magic link). Verified the existing `@supabase/ssr` setup for session management in middleware (`middleware.ts`, `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`), client (`lib/supabase/client.ts`), server (`lib/supabase/server.ts`), and provider (`components/SupabaseProvider.tsx`). Created a new client component for the login page (`app/admin/login/page.tsx`) with an email input, form handler calling `signInWithOtp`, and state management for loading/messages/errors. Set `emailRedirectTo` to handle the callback via `/auth/callback` before redirecting to `/admin`. Verified that the main admin page (`app/admin/page.tsx`) already contained server-side logic using `createClient` and `supabase.auth.getUser()` to redirect unauthenticated users to `/admin/login`. Verified the existing `LogoutButton.tsx` component correctly uses `useSupabase`, calls `supabase.auth.signOut()`, and redirects/refreshes.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/login/page.tsx`: Created new login page component.
  - `platform/src/middleware.ts`: Verified.
  - `platform/src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`: Verified.
  - `platform/src/lib/supabase/client.ts`: Verified.
  - `platform/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`: Verified.
  - `platform/src/components/SupabaseProvider.tsx`: Verified.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Verified route protection logic.
  - `platform/src/components/LogoutButton.tsx`: Verified logout logic.
- **Notes**: The core magic link authentication flow is implemented. Requires manual testing and potentially setting up the `/auth/callback` route if not already present (though `@supabase/ssr` might handle this implicitly). Fixed minor linting/type errors in the login page.

### Tech Debt: Persistent Vercel Build Error (PageProps Constraint) - [Status: Open] - [2025-04-03 18:26:00]
- **Identified**: 2025-04-03
- **Location**: `platform/src/app/admin/[entity]/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (multiple dynamic routes)
- **Description**: Vercel build consistently fails with a TypeScript error: `Type '{ params: { id: string; }; }' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'`. This occurred even after simplifying the page components significantly and attempting various type definition strategies.
- **Impact**: Blocks Vercel deployment.
- **Priority**: High (blocking deployment)
- **Proposed solution**: Temporarily removed the entire `/admin` section (`platform/src/app/admin`) and related components/links to allow deployment. Root cause needs further investigation (potential Next.js/TypeScript/Vercel interaction issue with dynamic routes).
- **Resolution Notes**: N/A / **Resolved Date**: N/A

## Implementation Notes
<!-- Append notes for features/components using the format below -->

### Implementation: FAQ Delete Functionality - 2025-04-01 23:05:00
- **Approach**: Implemented the delete flow for FAQ items. Verified the `deleteFaqItem` Server Action already existed in `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`. Created a new Client Component `FaqActions` (`platform/src/components/FaqActions.tsx`) similar to `ThemeActions` and `WorkshopActions` to encapsulate the Edit link and the Delete button. The Delete button is wrapped in a `<form>` whose `action` is bound to the `deleteFaqItem` server action with the specific `faqItemId`. An `onSubmit` handler uses `window.confirm` for confirmation. Modified the Admin FAQ list page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`) to import and use the `FaqActions` component, passing the `faqItemId`. Fixed TypeScript errors in `FaqActions.test.tsx` and `admin/faq/page.tsx` by changing default imports to named imports for `FaqActions`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/FaqActions.tsx`: Created new Client Component.
  - `platform/src/components/FaqActions.test.tsx`: Updated import to named import.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`: Imported and used `FaqActions` component, updated import to named import.
- **Notes**: FAQ Delete functionality is now implemented using Server Actions and client-side confirmation, consistent with Theme and Workshop delete patterns.



### Implementation: Theme Server Action Tests (add/update) - 2025-04-01 21:25:00
- **Approach**: Wrote unit tests for `addTheme` and `updateTheme` server actions using Vitest. Mocked Supabase client (`createClient`), `next/cache` (`revalidatePath`), and `next/navigation` (`redirect`). Used `beforeEach` to set up default successful mocks and reset mocks between tests. Used test-specific mocks (`mockResolvedValueOnce`) for error cases. Refactored tests and action code iteratively to resolve type errors and mock inconsistencies, particularly around chained Supabase calls (`.update().eq()`) and `useFormState` return types.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.test.ts`: Created test file, added tests for `addTheme` and `updateTheme`, refined mocks.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`: Adjusted function signatures, return types, field names (`title` vs `name`), and error handling to align with tests and `useFormState`.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Adjusted `action` prop type and field names (`title` vs `name`) to align with server actions and `useFormState`.
- **Notes**: Tests for `addTheme` and `updateTheme` are now passing. Encountered significant issues with mock setup consistency and diff tool application due to context window limitations. Tests for `deleteTheme` are written but still failing due to mock issues.


### Implementation: Update FAQ Functionality - 2025-04-01 15:11:48
- **Approach**: Implemented the update functionality for FAQ items. Created a new Server Action `updateFaqItem` in `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`. This action accepts the FAQ item `id` (bound) and `FormData`, extracts and processes form fields (question, answer, category, display_order - parsing string to number/null), uses the Supabase server client to update the corresponding record in `faq_items` table matching the `id`, includes error handling, revalidates `/admin/faq` and `/admin/faq/[id]/edit` paths on success, and redirects back to `/admin/faq`. Verified that `FaqForm` (`platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`) already correctly handled the required `action` prop and included the hidden `id` input when `initialData` was present. Verified that the "Add New FAQ" page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`) correctly passes the `addFaqItem` action. Updated the "Edit FAQ Item" page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to import the `updateFaqItem` action, bind the `faqItem.id` to it, and pass the bound action to the `FaqForm` component. Corrected an initial TypeScript error related to the import path for the action in the edit page.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`: Added `updateFaqItem` Server Action.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Imported and bound `updateFaqItem`, passed it to `FaqForm`, corrected import path.
- **Notes**: The update functionality for FAQ items is now complete, utilizing Server Actions for data mutation and revalidation.


### Implementation: Edit FAQ Data Fetching & Form Population - 2025-04-01 15:06:46
- **Approach**: Modified the Edit FAQ page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to be an `async` component. It now uses the Supabase server client (`createClient`) to fetch the specific FAQ item data based on the `id` from the route parameters using `.eq('id', id).single()`. Implemented error handling using `try...catch` and `notFound()` from `next/navigation` if the item isn't found. Passed the fetched `faqItem` data as the `initialData` prop to the `FaqForm` component. Modified the `FaqForm` component (`platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`) to accept an optional `initialData` prop (defining the `FaqItem` type locally for now) and used the `defaultValue` attribute on each form input (`question`, `answer`, `category`, `display_order`) to pre-populate the form. Also added a hidden input for the `id` when `initialData` is present.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Modified for data fetching, error handling, and passing props.
  - `platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`: Modified to accept `initialData` prop, define type, set default values, and include hidden ID input.
- **Notes**: This completes the data fetching and form population for editing FAQ items. The form currently uses a placeholder action; a specific `updateFaqItem` server action is needed for the actual update functionality. The `FaqItem` type was defined locally in both files; consider consolidating into a shared types file.


### Implementation: Admin FAQ Edit/Delete Actions & Route - 2025-04-01 15:02:52
- **Approach**: Modified the Admin FAQ list page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`) to add Edit/Delete actions. Changed the 'Add New FAQ Item' button to a `next/link` pointing to `/admin/faq/new`. Added a proper 'Actions' column header. Ensured the 'Edit' link in each row points to the correct dynamic route (`/admin/faq/[id]/edit`). Kept the 'Delete' button as a placeholder. Created the directory structure (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/`) and a basic placeholder page component (`page.tsx`) for the Edit FAQ route.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`: Modified to add Actions header, Edit link, Delete button, and update Add New link.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Created placeholder edit page.
- **Notes**: The Edit link now routes correctly. Delete functionality and the Edit page implementation (data fetching, form) are pending.

### Implementation: Add FAQ Form Submission - 2025-04-01 14:58:38
- **Approach**: Implemented the form submission logic for adding new FAQ items. Created a Server Action `addFaqItem` in `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`. This action handles `FormData` extraction (including parsing `display_order` to number or null), inserts the data into the Supabase `faq_items` table using the server client, handles potential database errors, revalidates the `/admin/faq` path on success, and finally redirects back to the FAQ list page. Updated the `FaqForm` component (`platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`) to accept the `addFaqItem` action via a required `action` prop and bind it to the `<form>` element. Updated the "Add New FAQ" page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`) to import and pass the `addFaqItem` action to the form component. Fixed TypeScript errors related to prop types and import paths.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/actions.ts`: Created Server Action file.
  - `platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`: Modified to accept and use the `action` prop, corrected prop type definition.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`: Modified to import and pass the action, corrected import path.
- **Notes**: The core functionality for adding FAQ items via the form is now implemented using Next.js Server Actions. Error handling in the action currently logs to the console.

### Implementation: Add New FAQ Page & Form - 2025-04-01 14:53:07
- **Approach**: Created the basic structure for adding new FAQ items. Created a new client component `FaqForm.tsx` (`platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`) containing a form with input fields for `question` (textarea), `answer` (textarea), `category` (text, optional), and `display_order` (number, optional), styled with Tailwind CSS. Added a submit button. Included TODO comments for future type definitions and props (like `initialData`, `action`). Created a new server component page `AddNewFaqPage` (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`) which renders a heading and includes the `FaqForm` component. Included TODO comments for importing and passing a server action to the form.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/FaqForm.tsx`: Created new component.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/faq/new/page.tsx`: Created new page.
- **Notes**: This sets up the UI for adding FAQ items. Form submission logic (Server Action) is not yet implemented.
### Implementation: Delete Workshop Functionality - 2025-04-01 14:49:36
- **Approach**: Implemented the delete flow for workshops. Added a `deleteWorkshop` Server Action to `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts` which accepts a workshop `id`, uses the Supabase server client to delete the corresponding record, handles errors, and revalidates the `/admin/workshops` path on success. Created a new Client Component `WorkshopActions` (`platform/src/components/WorkshopActions.tsx`) to encapsulate the Edit link and the Delete button. The Delete button is wrapped in a `<form>` whose `action` is bound to the `deleteWorkshop` server action with the specific `workshopId`. An `onSubmit` handler is added to the form which uses `window.confirm` to ask for user confirmation before allowing the form submission. Modified the Admin Workshops list page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx`) to import and use the `WorkshopActions` component, passing the `workshopId` as a prop, replacing the previous placeholder link/button.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`: Added `deleteWorkshop` function.
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopActions.tsx`: Created new Client Component.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx`: Imported and used `WorkshopActions` component.
- **Notes**: Delete functionality is now implemented with server-side logic via Server Actions and client-side confirmation. Error handling in the server action currently logs to the console.



### Implementation: Update Workshop Functionality - 2025-04-01 14:44:30
- **Approach**: Implemented the full update flow for workshops. Added the `updateWorkshop` Server Action to `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`, handling form data extraction (including parsing `relevant_themes` JSON and `max_capacity` number), Supabase update operation using `.match({ id })`, error handling, revalidation of relevant paths (`/admin/workshops`, `/admin/workshops/[id]/edit`), and redirect on success. Modified `WorkshopForm` (`platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`) to make the `action` prop required again (it was previously made optional). Updated the "Edit Workshop" page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to import `updateWorkshop`, bind the workshop `id` to it, and pass the bound action to `WorkshopForm`. Resolved TypeScript errors related to the required `action` prop and handling `unknown` type for fetched data by defining a local interface and using type assertion. Verified "Add New Workshop" page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`) still correctly passes the `addWorkshop` action.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`: Added `updateWorkshop` function.
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`: Made `action` prop required.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Imported, bound, and passed `updateWorkshop` action; added local interface and type assertion.
- **Notes**: The update functionality for workshops is now implemented using Server Actions. Type safety for fetched data relies on a local interface and assertion due to missing global DB types.



### Implementation: Admin Workshops Edit Route - 2025-04-01 14:31:47
- **Approach**: Created the directory structure (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/[id]/edit/`) and a basic placeholder page component (`page.tsx`) for the Edit Workshop route. The placeholder page includes a heading displaying the workshop ID and indicates where the workshop editing form will be placed. This was done in response to the task to add Edit/Delete actions, but the actions were already present in the list page.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Created placeholder edit page.
- **Notes**: The Edit link in the workshops list page (`/admin/workshops`) now correctly routes to this dynamic page. The page is a basic placeholder awaiting data fetching and form implementation.


### Implementation: Add Workshop Form Submission - 2025-04-01 14:28:41
- **Approach**: Implemented the form submission logic for adding new workshops. Created a Server Action `addWorkshop` in `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`. This action handles `FormData` extraction, parses the `relevant_themes` field from a JSON string (with error handling for invalid JSON), parses `max_capacity` to a number (handling invalid input), inserts the data into the Supabase `workshops` table, handles potential database errors, revalidates the `/admin/workshops` path on success, and finally redirects back to the workshops list page. Updated the `WorkshopForm` component (`platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`) to accept the `addWorkshop` action via props and bind it to the `<form>` element. Updated the "Add New Workshop" page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`) to import and pass the `addWorkshop` action to the form component. Resolved intermediate TypeScript/ESLint errors related to locating Supabase type definitions (used `unknown` as a fallback) and incorrect import paths.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/actions.ts`: Created Server Action file.
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`: Modified to accept and use the `action` prop.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`: Modified to import and pass the action.
- **Notes**: The core functionality for adding workshops via the form is now implemented using Next.js Server Actions. A temporary `unknown` type is used for Supabase data due to the missing `database.types.ts` file, which should be addressed later for better type safety.


### Implementation: Add New Workshop Page & Form - 2025-04-01 14:21:03
- **Approach**: Created the basic structure for adding new workshops. Created a new client component `WorkshopForm.tsx` (`platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`) containing a form with input fields for `title`, `description`, `relevant_themes` (textarea for JSONB), `facilitator` (optional), and `max_capacity` (optional), styled with Tailwind CSS. Added a submit button. Included TODO comments for future type definitions, props (like `initialData`, `action`), and state management. Created a new server component page `AddNewWorkshopPage` (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`) which renders a heading and includes the `WorkshopForm` component. Included TODO comments for importing and passing a server action to the form.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/WorkshopForm.tsx`: Created new component.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/new/page.tsx`: Created new page.
- **Notes**: This sets up the UI for adding workshops. Form submission logic (Server Action) is not yet implemented.


### Implementation: Delete Theme Functionality - 2025-04-01 14:17:07
- **Approach**: Implemented the delete flow for themes. Added a `deleteTheme` Server Action to `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts` which accepts a theme `id`, uses the Supabase server client to delete the corresponding record, handles errors, and revalidates the `/admin/themes` path on success. Created a new Client Component `ThemeActions` (`platform/src/components/ThemeActions.tsx`) to encapsulate the Edit link and the Delete button. The Delete button is wrapped in a `<form>` whose `action` is bound to the `deleteTheme` server action with the specific `themeId`. An `onSubmit` handler is added to the form which uses `window.confirm` to ask for user confirmation before allowing the form submission (and thus the server action execution) to proceed. Modified the Admin Themes list page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`) to import and use the `ThemeActions` component, passing the `themeId` as a prop.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`: Added `deleteTheme` function.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeActions.tsx`: Created new Client Component.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`: Imported and used `ThemeActions` component.
- **Notes**: Delete functionality is now implemented with server-side logic and client-side confirmation. Error handling in the server action currently logs to the console.


### Implementation: Update Theme Functionality - 2025-04-01 14:11:48
- **Approach**: Implemented the full update flow for themes. Created the `updateTheme` Server Action in `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`, handling form data, Supabase update, error logging, revalidation, and redirect. Modified `ThemeForm` (`platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`) to accept a generic `action` prop (matching the expected type for form actions), and added a hidden input field for the theme `id` when `initialData` is present. Updated the "Add New Theme" page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx`) to pass the `addTheme` action. Updated the "Edit Theme" page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to import `updateTheme`, bind the theme `id` to it using `.bind(null, theme.id)`, and pass the bound action to `ThemeForm`. Corrected TypeScript errors related to action prop types and import paths. Modified server actions to return `void` on error to satisfy form action type requirements, relying on console logs for error feedback for now.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`: Added `updateTheme` function, modified error returns in both actions.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Modified props interface (`action` type), added hidden `id` input, updated form `action` attribute.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx`: Imported `addTheme` and passed it to `ThemeForm`.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Imported `updateTheme`, bound `id`, passed bound action to `ThemeForm`, corrected import path.
- **Notes**: The update functionality is now implemented. Error handling in server actions currently relies on console logs; future improvement could involve returning status/messages to the form.

### Implementation: Edit Theme Page Data Fetching & Form Population - 2025-04-01 14:05:15
- **Approach**: Modified the Edit Theme page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`) to be an `async` component. It now uses the Supabase server client (`createClient`) to fetch the specific theme data based on the `id` from the route parameters. Implemented error handling using `try...catch` and used `notFound()` from `next/navigation` to render a 404 page if the theme isn't found. Passed the fetched `theme` data as the `initialData` prop to the `ThemeForm` component. Modified the `ThemeForm` component (`platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`) to accept an optional `initialData` prop of type `Theme`. Used the `defaultValue` attribute on each form input (`title`, `description`, `analytic_tradition`, `continental_tradition`) to pre-populate the form with the values from `initialData` if provided.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Modified for data fetching and passing props.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Modified to accept `initialData` prop and set default values.
- **Notes**: This completes the initial setup for editing themes. The form currently uses the `addTheme` server action; a separate `updateTheme` action will be needed for actual updates. The `Theme` type was defined locally in both files; consider consolidating into a shared types file.


### Implementation: Admin Themes Edit/Delete Actions & Route - 2025-04-01 14:00:36
- **Approach**: Modified the Admin Themes list page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`) to replace placeholder action icons with functional links/buttons. Added a `next/link` component for the "Edit" action, pointing to the dynamic route `/admin/themes/[id]/edit`. Added a placeholder `<button>` for the "Delete" action (functionality TBD). Created the necessary directory structure (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/`) and a basic placeholder page component (`page.tsx`) for the Edit Theme route. The placeholder page includes a heading and indicates where the theme editing form will be placed.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`: Modified to add Edit link and Delete button.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`: Created placeholder edit page.
- **Notes**: The Edit link now correctly routes to a dynamic page based on the theme ID. The Delete button is styled but has no functionality yet. The Edit page is a basic placeholder awaiting data fetching and form implementation.


### Implementation: Add Theme Form Submission (Server Action) - 2025-04-01 13:56:49
- **Approach**: Created a Server Action (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`) named `addTheme` to handle form submissions from `ThemeForm`. The action retrieves form data, performs basic validation, uses the Supabase server client to insert the new theme into the `themes` table, includes error handling, and upon successful insertion, revalidates the `/admin/themes` path and redirects the user back to the themes list page. Updated the `ThemeForm` component (`platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`) to import this action and assign it to the `<form>` element's `action` prop.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/app/admin/themes/actions.ts`: Created the Server Action file.
  - `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Modified to import and use the Server Action.
- **Notes**: This implements the core logic for adding new themes through the admin interface. Error handling in the action currently logs to the console; more user-facing feedback could be added later.


### Implementation: ThemeForm Component - 2025-04-01 13:53:00
- **Approach**: Created a new client component (`platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`) to handle theme creation/editing. Included input fields for `title` (text), `description` (textarea), `analytic_tradition` (textarea, optional), and `continental_tradition` (textarea, optional), styled with Tailwind CSS. Added a submit button. Included TODO comments for future implementation of state management and form submission logic (e.g., using Server Actions).
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/components/ThemeForm.tsx`: Created the component.
- **Notes**: Marked as `'use client'`. Basic form structure without state or submission handling.

### Implementation: Add New Theme Page - 2025-04-01 13:53:00
- **Approach**: Created a new server component page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx`) for adding new themes. Rendered a heading ("Add New Theme") and imported/rendered the `ThemeForm` component. Included commented-out placeholder code and TODOs for implementing a Server Action to handle form submission.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/themes/new/page.tsx`: Created the page component.
- **Notes**: This page provides the UI for adding themes. Form submission logic is pending.

### Implementation: Admin Manage FAQ Page - 2025-04-01 13:49:19
- **Approach**: Created a new server component page (`platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`) for managing FAQ items. Implemented server-side data fetching using the Supabase server client (`@/lib/supabase/server`) by awaiting `createClient()` and then calling `.from('faq_items').select('*').order('created_at', { ascending: false })`. Included error handling for the fetch operation. Rendered a basic page layout with a title, a placeholder "Add New FAQ Item" button, and an HTML table styled with Tailwind CSS to display the fetched FAQ items (question and answer). Handled the case where no FAQ items are found. Added placeholder action links/buttons (edit/delete) in the table. Fixed initial TypeScript error related to incorrect `await` usage for `createClient`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/faq/page.tsx`: Created the page component.
- **Notes**: This page provides the basic structure for FAQ management. Actual add/edit/delete functionality is not yet implemented. The `FaqItem` interface was defined locally; consider moving to a shared types file if reused.


### Implementation: Admin Manage Workshops Page - 2025-04-01 13:45:37
- **Approach**: Created a new server component page (`platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx`) for managing workshops. Implemented server-side data fetching using the Supabase server client (`@/lib/supabase/server`) by awaiting `createClient()` and then calling `.from('workshops').select('*')`. Included error handling for the fetch operation. Rendered a basic page layout with a title, a placeholder "Add New Workshop" button (linking to `/admin/workshops/new`), and an HTML table styled with Tailwind CSS to display the fetched workshops (title and description). Handled the case where no workshops are found. Added placeholder action buttons (edit/delete) in the table. Fixed initial TypeScript errors related to `any` types and incorrect `await` usage for `createClient`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/workshops/page.tsx`: Created the page component.
- **Notes**: This page provides the basic structure for workshop management. Actual add/edit/delete functionality is not yet implemented. The `Workshop` interface was defined locally; consider moving to a shared types file if reused. Replaced `any` with `unknown` for JSONB and error types.


### Implementation: Admin Manage Themes Page - 2025-04-01 13:41:42
- **Approach**: Created a new server component page (`platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`) for managing themes. Implemented server-side data fetching using the Supabase server client (`@/lib/supabase/server`) to retrieve all records from the `themes` table. Included error handling for the fetch operation. Rendered a basic page layout with a title, a placeholder "Add New Theme" button (linking to `/admin/themes/new`), and an HTML table styled with Tailwind CSS to display the fetched themes (title and description). Handled the case where no themes are found. Added placeholder action buttons (edit/delete) in the table. Corrected initial Supabase client usage based on `server.ts` implementation.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/themes/page.tsx`: Created the page component.
- **Notes**: This page provides the basic structure for theme management. Actual add/edit/delete functionality is not yet implemented. The `Theme` interface was defined locally; consider moving to a shared types file if reused.


### Implementation: Admin Content Management Links - 2025-04-01 13:36:54
- **Approach**: Added navigation links for content management (Themes, Workshops, FAQ) to the Admin Dashboard UI. Used `next/link` components and styled them with Tailwind CSS within the `AdminDashboardClient.tsx` component.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/components/AdminDashboardClient.tsx`: Added `Link` import and JSX for navigation links.
- **Notes**: Links point to `/admin/themes`, `/admin/workshops`, and `/admin/faq`. Basic button styling applied.


### Implementation: Admin Dashboard UI Structure - 2025-04-01 13:03:25
- **Approach**: Updated existing admin page (`platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) to include more specific placeholders for content management links and registration data view (DataTable, StatusFilters) based on project specifications. Imported `next/link`.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Added placeholder UI elements and links.
- **Notes**: Basic structure is in place. Next steps involve creating actual components/pages for these placeholders (e.g., DataTable, content management forms).

### Implementation: Admin Registrations Data Fetching - 2025-04-01 13:08:00
- **Approach**: Modified `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx` to use the Supabase server client (`createClient`) to fetch all records from the `registrations` table. Included basic error logging and passed the fetched data (or an empty array) to the DataTable placeholder.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Added data fetching logic and updated DataTable placeholder.
- **Notes**: Fetches all columns (`*`) for now. Error handling is basic (console log). Data is passed to a placeholder; actual `DataTable` component implementation is pending.


### Implementation: DataTable Component - 2025-04-01 13:14:45
- **Approach**: Created a new component `platform/src/components/DataTable.tsx` to display registration data. Defined a `Registration` interface based on the schema in `docs/project_specifications.md`. The component accepts `registrations` data as a prop, renders an HTML table with Tailwind CSS, displays key columns (`full_name`, `email`, `academic_year`, `program`, `status`), and handles empty data states. Addressed ESLint errors by replacing `any` with `Record<string, unknown>` for JSONB types.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/components/DataTable.tsx`: Created the component.
- **Notes**: This component provides a basic view of registration data. Future enhancements could include sorting, filtering (handled by a separate component), pagination, and more detailed display of JSONB fields.

### Implementation: Integrate DataTable in Admin Page - 2025-04-01 13:14:45
- **Approach**: Imported the newly created `DataTable` component into `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`. Replaced the placeholder div with the `<DataTable registrations={registrationData} />` component call, passing the fetched registration data.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Imported and used the `DataTable` component.
- **Notes**: The admin page now renders the actual data table instead of a placeholder.

### Implementation: StatusFilters Component - 2025-04-01 13:19:08
- **Approach**: Created a new component `platform/src/components/StatusFilters.tsx` to display filter buttons ('All', 'Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected') using Tailwind CSS for styling. Integrated this component into the Admin page (`platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`) above the DataTable.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**: `platform/src/components/StatusFilters.tsx`: Created the component. `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Imported and used the `StatusFilters` component.
- **Notes**: The filter buttons are currently non-functional (UI only). State management and filtering logic will be added later.


### Implementation: Admin Registration Client-Side Filtering - 2025-04-01 13:33:33
- **Approach**: Implemented client-side filtering for the registration table on the Admin page. Refactored the data display logic into a new client component (`AdminDashboardClient.tsx`) which takes initial data fetched by the server component (`admin/page.tsx`). The client component uses `useState` to manage the active filter ('All', 'Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected'). The `StatusFilters.tsx` component was updated to accept the current filter and a callback function (`onFilterChange`) as props, adding `onClick` handlers and active state styling to its buttons. The `AdminDashboardClient` filters the `initialRegistrations` based on the `currentFilter` state before passing the result to the `DataTable` component.
- **Key Files Modified/Created**:
  - `platform/src/components/AdminDashboardClient.tsx`: Created. Handles state, filtering logic, and renders `StatusFilters` and `DataTable`.
  - `platform/src/components/StatusFilters.tsx`: Modified to accept props (`currentFilter`, `onFilterChange`), added `onClick` handlers and active styling.
  - `platform/src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Modified to remain a Server Component, fetch initial data, and render `AdminDashboardClient` passing the data as props. Removed direct rendering of `StatusFilters` and `DataTable`.
- **Notes**: This separates server-side data fetching from client-side interactivity, following Next.js best practices. The `Registration` type was duplicated in `AdminDashboardClient.tsx`; consider moving it to a shared types file (`platform/src/lib/types.ts`?) if it's needed elsewhere.
