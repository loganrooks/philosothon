## Intervention Log
### [2025-04-18 16:38:00] Intervention: Reprioritization due to UI Issues & Git Debt
- **Trigger**: User feedback reporting persistent UI issues (fonts, spacing), dissatisfaction with Navbar/hyperlinks, and highlighting large amount of unstaged changes violating Git workflow. User also noted build error with `font-philosopher` class.
- **Context**: Multiple tasks completed (public page fixes, admin rebuild, dynamic themes, build fixes, dependency downgrade, testing) but UI state regressed/remained unsatisfactory, and Git hygiene was neglected. Build error with `@apply font-philosopher` persisted despite downgrade.
- **Action Taken**: Halted planned task (Task 24: Re-enable Global Font Rule). Reprioritized workflow: 1) Log intervention. 2) Address Git debt. 3) Systematically debug UI/font/spacing issues. 4) Refactor Navbar. 5) Refactor hyperlinks.
- **Rationale**: Essential to establish a stable codebase state (clean Git history, working build, reliable styling foundation) before adding more features or complex refactors. Adheres to best practices and user's explicit concerns.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is delegating Git cleanup task.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure subsequent tasks adhere strictly to the defined Git workflow. Add build verification step to standard post-code/post-test workflow.
