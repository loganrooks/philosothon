## Intervention Log
### [2025-04-18 16:38:00] Intervention: Reprioritization due to UI Issues & Git Debt
- **Trigger**: User feedback reporting persistent UI issues (fonts, spacing), dissatisfaction with Navbar/hyperlinks, and highlighting large amount of unstaged changes violating Git workflow. User also noted build error with `font-philosopher` class.
- **Context**: Multiple tasks completed (public page fixes, admin rebuild, dynamic themes, build fixes, dependency downgrade, testing) but UI state regressed/remained unsatisfactory, and Git hygiene was neglected. Build error with `@apply font-philosopher` persisted despite downgrade.
- **Action Taken**: Halted planned task (Task 24: Re-enable Global Font Rule). Reprioritized workflow: 1) Log intervention. 2) Address Git debt. 3) Systematically debug UI/font/spacing issues. 4) Refactor Navbar. 5) Refactor hyperlinks.
- **Rationale**: Essential to establish a stable codebase state (clean Git history, working build, reliable styling foundation) before adding more features or complex refactors. Adheres to best practices and user's explicit concerns.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is delegating Git cleanup task.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure subsequent tasks adhere strictly to the defined Git workflow. Add build verification step to standard post-code/post-test workflow.

<!-- Add previous delegations here reverse chronologically -->
### [2025-04-18 17:20:00] Intervention: Git Workflow Adherence Reminder
- **Trigger**: User reminder after SPARC proposed delegating next task (Task 26 - Font Debug) immediately after merging branches (Task 26 - Merge).
- **Context**: `main` branch was clean after merges, but SPARC failed to instruct user/delegate task to create a new feature branch *before* starting the next development task, violating the defined workflow (`docs/git_workflow.md`).
- **Action Taken**: Halted delegation of Task 26 (Font Debug). Logged intervention. Will now ask user to confirm next task priority *and* remind them to create the appropriate feature branch first.
- **Rationale**: Enforce defined Git workflow for stability and organization.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Workflow corrected.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure all future task delegations explicitly mention the prerequisite of creating a feature branch off `main`.
### [2025-04-18 17:23:00] Intervention: Repeated Git Workflow Violation
- **Trigger**: User reminder (second time) after SPARC proposed delegating Task 26 (Font Debug) without ensuring work was happening on a feature branch. User explicitly noted unstaged changes exist.
- **Context**: Despite defining the workflow (Task 11) and cleaning the repo (Task 25/26), SPARC immediately proposed new work without instructing the user/delegating a task to create a feature branch off `main`. This indicates a systemic failure in SPARC's process adherence.
- **Action Taken**: Halted delegation of Task 26 (Font Debug). Logged intervention. Will request clarification on current Git status before proceeding.
- **Rationale**: Enforce defined Git workflow *before* any new changes are made. Address SPARC's failure to follow established process.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Workflow corrected again.
- **Follow-up**: SPARC must explicitly check/confirm branch status or instruct branch creation *before* delegating any task involving code changes. Add self-check rule for SPARC.
### [2025-04-18 17:24:00] Intervention: Git Workflow Violation (Unstaged Changes on Main)
- **Trigger**: User provided `git status` output showing unstaged changes on `main` after Task 26 (Merge) was reported complete with a clean state.
- **Context**: SPARC failed to ensure subsequent tasks (Task 27 - Direct Font Application, Task 28 - Testing) were performed on a new feature branch, leading to modifications directly on `main`.
- **Action Taken**: Halted proposed Task 26 (Re-issue Font Debug). Logged intervention. Will delegate task to clean the `main` branch by committing unstaged changes to a new branch.
- **Rationale**: Critical to maintain a clean `main` branch and adhere strictly to the defined Git workflow (`docs/git_workflow.md`).
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is delegating Git cleanup task (Task 29).
- **Follow-up**: SPARC *must* verify branch status or instruct branch creation *before every* code modification task delegation. Implement stricter self-checks.
### [2025-04-18 18:54:00] Intervention: Git Workflow Violation (Unstaged Debug Changes on Main)
- **Trigger**: User provided `git status` output showing unstaged changes on `main` after SPARC incorrectly assumed `main` was clean post-Task 29.
- **Context**: SPARC failed *again* to ensure work (Tasks 30-37, Tailwind debugging) happened on a feature branch (`debug/tailwind-integration` was suggested but apparently not used/enforced). Changes were made directly on `main`.
- **Action Taken**: Halted proposed Navbar task. Logged intervention. Will delegate task to clean `main` branch *again* by committing unstaged debug changes to a new branch.
- **Rationale**: Critical failure to maintain clean `main` branch and adhere to workflow. Must correct state before proceeding.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is delegating Git cleanup task (Task 38).
- **Follow-up**: SPARC requires significant improvement in enforcing Git workflow adherence before *any* task delegation involving code changes. Stricter self-checks needed.
### [2025-04-18 19:32:00] Intervention: Failed Feature Implementation (Task 44 - Form Embed) & Insufficient Testing
- **Trigger**: User feedback indicating Task 44 (Form Embed Responsiveness) failed visually despite passing tests (Task 45).
- **Context**: `code` mode implemented responsive classes, `tdd` mode updated tests which passed, but visual outcome was incorrect. Tests were insufficient to capture visual requirement. SPARC incorrectly prompted user to merge.
- **Action Taken**: Halted merge suggestion. Logged intervention. Will delegate task to revert/reset the `feature/form-embed-responsive` branch. Will then re-initiate TDD cycle with focus on better test specification/implementation for visual responsiveness.
- **Rationale**: Correct failed implementation using proper TDD with more robust testing. Address SPARC's failure to ensure tests adequately cover requirements.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is Git rollback/reset.
- **Follow-up**: Emphasize need for tests that better reflect visual/responsive requirements in future TDD cycles.
### [2025-04-18 19:34:00] Intervention: Workflow Adjustment - Continue on Feature Branch
- **Trigger**: User decision after SPARC proposed resetting `feature/form-embed-responsive` (Task 46).
- **Context**: Task 44 on `feature/form-embed-responsive` failed visual verification. SPARC proposed resetting the branch. User opted to continue development on the existing branch instead.
- **Action Taken**: Cancelled Task 46 (Reset Branch). Logged intervention. Will proceed with debugging/re-implementing the form embed responsiveness on the current `feature/form-embed-responsive` branch.
- **Rationale**: Follow user direction to iterate on the existing branch.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is re-attempting the form embed fix.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure subsequent tasks operate on the correct branch (`feature/form-embed-responsive`).
### [2025-04-18 19:56:00] Intervention: Reprioritization based on Visual Feedback & Admin Questions
- **Trigger**: User feedback after visually checking the site, highlighting specific UI issues (Proposal page style, dark fonts) and asking about theme population/admin access.
- **Context**: SPARC was about to ask for the next priority after completing the form embed fix. User provided concrete issues instead.
- **Action Taken**: Halted asking for next general priority. Logged intervention. Will address admin access/theme population questions first, then delegate tasks for specific UI fixes (Proposal styling, dark fonts) after confirming the previous feature branch (`feature/form-embed-responsive`) is merged and a new one is created.
- **Rationale**: Address user's immediate, concrete concerns and questions before proceeding with broader tasks. Ensure correct Git state.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Plan adjusted.
- **Follow-up**: Confirm merge, then delegate specific UI fixes.
### [2025-04-18 22:57:00] Intervention: Clarification on Dark Text UI Issue
- **Trigger**: User feedback specifying locations (descriptions, blockquotes, timeline, register page) and likely classes (`text-gray-600/700`) causing readability issues.
- **Context**: Following Task 58 (attempted text color fix), user confirmed issues remain in specific areas.
- **Action Taken**: Logged clarification. Will now search for and replace problematic dark text classes.
- **Rationale**: Address specific user feedback systematically.
- **Outcome**: Clarification logged. Next step is searching for dark text classes.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate search and replace task.
### [2025-04-18 23:15:00] Intervention: Reprioritization to General UI Aesthetic
- **Trigger**: User decision after SPARC proposed Navbar refactor (Task 23).
- **Context**: User wants to address the overall "minimal hacker/coder aesthetic" before component-specific refactors like the Navbar.
- **Action Taken**: Halted proposed Task 23 (Navbar). Logged intervention. Will delegate a broader UI overhaul task (Task 61).
- **Rationale**: Address user's higher-level aesthetic goals first.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is delegating UI overhaul task.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure subsequent UI tasks align with the established aesthetic.
### [2025-04-18 23:38:00] Intervention: Incorrect Font Application & Git Workflow Violation (Task 61)
- **Trigger**: User feedback rejecting monospace font suggestion, providing DevTools output showing incorrect body font rendering (Segoe UI instead of Inter), and reminding about Git workflow violation.
- **Context**: SPARC incorrectly assumed monospace was desired for the hacker aesthetic and failed *again* to ensure Task 61 was performed on its feature branch (`feature/hacker-aesthetic`). The body font ('Inter') loaded via `next/font` is not applying correctly.
- **Action Taken**: Halted proposed Task 62 (Regression Tests). Logged intervention. Will prioritize cleaning `main` branch by moving Task 61 changes, then debugging the 'Inter' font application.
- **Rationale**: Correct critical font rendering issue and repeated Git workflow failure.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is Git cleanup (Task 63).
- **Follow-up**: SPARC must verify font loading and application in `layout.tsx` and `tailwind.config.ts`. Implement stricter Git checks.
### [2025-04-18 23:40:00] Intervention: Workflow Adjustment - Consolidate UI Work on `ui-overhaul` Branch
- **Trigger**: User clarification stating they are already on a `ui-overhaul` branch and want to consolidate all UI work there, overriding SPARC's multi-branch/cleanup plan.
- **Context**: SPARC proposed Task 63 to clean `main` and commit Task 61 changes to `feature/hacker-aesthetic`. User stated they are already on `ui-overhaul` where this work belongs.
- **Action Taken**: Cancelled Task 63 (Git Cleanup). Logged intervention. Will proceed with debugging/implementing UI changes directly on the user's `ui-overhaul` branch. Will first commit existing unstaged changes on this branch.
- **Rationale**: Follow user's explicit direction for branch management during this UI overhaul phase. Acknowledge deviation from standard GitHub Flow.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Workflow adjusted.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure all subsequent UI tasks operate on the `ui-overhaul` branch. Commit changes frequently on this branch.
### [2025-04-19 00:00:00] Intervention: Aesthetic Goal Clarification (Monospace Default)
- **Trigger**: User feedback after Task 66 ('Inter' font fix), stating 'Inter' doesn't fit the hacker aesthetic and requesting *all* fonts be monospace.
- **Context**: SPARC/code previously implemented 'Inter' as the default body font based on earlier interpretations. User explicitly corrected this.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Will delegate task to make `font-mono` the default font applied to the `<body>` tag.
- **Rationale**: Align implementation with clarified user aesthetic requirement.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is applying monospace font globally.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure subsequent styling tasks adhere to the monospace-first aesthetic.
### [2025-04-19 00:45:00] Intervention: Process Improvement (Visual Verification) & Aesthetic Refinement (Sharp Corners)
- **Trigger**: User feedback after SPARC requested verification for Task 69 (Navbar refinement). User pointed out verification should happen *before* completion logging and requested sharp corners as part of the aesthetic.
- **Context**: SPARC/modes were logging completion after build/test pass, leading to back-and-forth when visual checks failed. Aesthetic requirement needed refinement.
- **Action Taken**: Logged intervention. Explicitly adopted process change: User visual verification is now required *before* UI task completion. Halted further Navbar refinement. Will prioritize removing rounded corners as part of the aesthetic overhaul.
- **Rationale**: Improve workflow efficiency by incorporating user verification earlier. Refine aesthetic implementation based on specific feedback.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Process adjusted. Next step is removing rounded corners.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure all modes request user verification for UI tasks before completion. Ensure subsequent UI tasks implement sharp corners.
### [2025-04-19 02:48:00] Intervention: Git Workflow Adjustment (Grouped Feature Branches)
- **Trigger**: User feedback during handover task, clarifying preference for grouping related tasks onto larger feature branches (e.g., `ui-overhaul`) instead of creating many small branches.
- **Context**: Previous SPARC instance (and handover message) emphasized atomic commits potentially implying micro-branches, causing user concern about overhead.
- **Action Taken**: Halted handover task. Logged intervention. Will update handover message to reflect preference for grouped feature branches while maintaining the core principle of working off `main`.
- **Rationale**: Adapt workflow to user preference for efficiency while still ensuring `main` remains clean.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Handover message will be updated.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future branch creation guidance reflects this preference for grouping related tasks.
### [2025-04-19 02:50:00] Intervention: Create Detailed Spec v2 Before Handover
- **Trigger**: User feedback requesting a new, *detailed* specification document (v2) for the expanded project vision before handing over to a new SPARC instance.
- **Context**: SPARC proposed handover due to context limits and new scope. User identified the need for a full v2 specification first, clarifying previous ambiguity between high-level vision and detailed specs.
- **Action Taken**: Halted handover task. Logged intervention. Will delegate task to `spec-pseudocode` mode to engage user, clarify requirements, and draft `docs/project_specifications_v2.md`.
- **Rationale**: Ensure a clear and detailed v2 specification exists before transitioning orchestration, improving handover success and aligning with user requirements.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Next step is delegating v2 spec creation.
- **Follow-up**: Re-attempt handover only after `docs/project_specifications_v2.md` is created and approved.
### [2025-04-19 02:56:00] Intervention: Insufficient Detail in Task Delegation (Task 76)
- **Trigger**: User denied `new_task` for Task 76 (`spec-pseudocode`), stating the instructions lacked necessary details from their original vision statement.
- **Context**: SPARC provided high-level categories for clarification but omitted specific details mentioned by the user (e.g., email blurbs, submission receipts, multiple submissions, printed copies, date handling).
- **Action Taken**: Halted task delegation. Logged intervention. Will re-delegate Task 76 with significantly more detailed instructions for clarification points.
- **Rationale**: Ensure delegated tasks accurately reflect the user's specific requirements and context to avoid wasted effort. Improve SPARC's requirement gathering translation.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Task 76 will be re-delegated with improved detail.
- **Follow-up**: SPARC must more carefully parse user requests for specific details when formulating delegation instructions.
### [2025-04-19 02:58:00] Intervention: Improved Specification Delegation Process
- **Trigger**: User feedback on Task 76 delegation, stating instructions should include an attempted translation of requirements, not just questions.
- **Context**: SPARC delegated spec drafting by only listing clarification questions, placing the initial interpretation burden on the user.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task delegation. Logged intervention. Will re-delegate Task 76 instructing `spec-pseudocode` mode to first draft preliminary requirements based on user's vision, then present draft + clarifying questions via `ask_followup_question`.
- **Rationale**: Improve efficiency and accuracy of specification phase by having the AI perform initial translation, facilitating focused user feedback. Aligns better with SPARC principles.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Task 76 delegation instructions will be revised.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure all future specification tasks follow this "draft-then-clarify" approach.
### [2025-04-19 03:00:00] Intervention: Insufficient Context in Task Delegation (Task 76)
- **Trigger**: User denied `new_task` for Task 76 (`spec-pseudocode`), stating the mode wouldn't have access to the original message containing the vision details.
- **Context**: SPARC instructed the mode to reference a previous message by timestamp, failing to recognize that new mode instances lack chat history access. Necessary context was not provided directly.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task delegation. Logged intervention. Will re-delegate Task 76, ensuring the user's vision statement details are included *within* the task message itself.
- **Rationale**: Ensure delegated modes receive all necessary context directly within their starting message. Improve SPARC's understanding of context limitations between tasks.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Task 76 delegation instructions will be revised to include context.
- **Follow-up**: SPARC must always include necessary prior context directly in `new_task` messages.
### [2025-04-19 03:02:00] Intervention: Refined "Draft-then-Ask" Spec Process
- **Trigger**: User feedback on Task 76 (Revised Approach v2) delegation, clarifying that the AI should attempt a more concrete translation/draft of requirements *before* asking questions, presenting both together.
- **Context**: SPARC's previous instruction still focused too heavily on asking questions based on the summary, rather than presenting an initial interpretation first.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task delegation. Logged intervention. Will re-delegate Task 76 instructing `spec-pseudocode` mode to: 1) Draft preliminary requirements for each vision point. 2) Use `ask_followup_question` to present *both* the draft interpretation *and* specific clarifying questions for user feedback.
- **Rationale**: Ensure the AI performs sufficient initial interpretation, making the clarification process more efficient and targeted for the user.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Task 76 delegation instructions will be revised again.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure future specification tasks explicitly follow this refined "draft interpretation + ask clarification" pattern.
### [2025-04-19 03:04:00] Intervention: Insufficient Detail in Spec Draft Interpretation (Task 76)
- **Trigger**: User feedback on Task 76 (Revised Approach v2) delegation, stating the instruction for the initial draft interpretation was still too vague ("one or two sentences per feature") and demanding a more detailed translation of their vision *before* questions are asked.
- **Context**: SPARC failed to adequately convey the required depth for the initial draft interpretation step in the "draft-then-ask" process.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task delegation. Logged intervention. Will re-delegate Task 76 instructing `spec-pseudocode` mode to perform a *detailed* initial translation of *all* user points for a given feature area into multiple preliminary requirement statements, then present this detailed draft alongside clarifying questions.
- **Rationale**: Ensure the AI performs a thorough initial interpretation, reducing user burden and leading to more productive clarification cycles.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Task 76 delegation instructions will be revised for greater initial drafting depth.
- **Follow-up**: SPARC must ensure instructions for drafting modes emphasize comprehensive initial interpretation based on all available user input.
### [2025-04-19 03:06:00] Intervention: Insufficient Context Detail (Full Message Needed) in Task Delegation (Task 76)
- **Trigger**: User denied `new_task` for Task 76 (Final Revised Approach v2), stating the *full details* of their original message were still missing from the task instructions.
- **Context**: SPARC provided a summary of the user's vision but failed to include the verbatim text, preventing the `spec-pseudocode` mode from having the complete necessary context for interpretation.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task delegation. Logged intervention. Will re-delegate Task 76, this time embedding the user's *entire relevant message* within the task instructions for the `spec-pseudocode` mode.
- **Rationale**: Ensure the delegated mode has the complete, verbatim source material required for accurate interpretation and requirement drafting, minimizing back-and-forth. Address SPARC's failure to provide adequate context.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Task 76 delegation instructions will be revised to include the full user message.
- **Follow-up**: SPARC must prioritize including complete, verbatim user requirement statements in relevant task delegations.
### [2025-04-19 03:08:00] Intervention: Refined Specification Process (Capture vs. Decide)
- **Trigger**: User feedback on Task 76 (Final Revised Approach v2) delegation, clarifying the goal is to capture requirements (stated + implied) and explicitly *defer* implementation decisions, minimizing immediate questions.
- **Context**: SPARC's instructions still implied too much ambiguity resolution during the initial spec drafting phase.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task delegation. Logged intervention. Will re-delegate Task 76 instructing `spec-pseudocode` mode to focus on translating the user's vision into requirement statements, adding logically implied needs, explicitly noting areas where design decisions are deferred, and only asking questions if core intent is unclear.
- **Rationale**: Align the specification process with the user's need to define *what* is required before exploring *how* it will be built, avoiding premature design choices and excessive questioning.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Task 76 delegation instructions will be revised accordingly.
- **Follow-up**: Ensure SPARC and `spec-pseudocode` differentiate between capturing requirements and making design decisions in future tasks.
### [2025-04-19 03:14:00] Intervention: Unnecessary Clarification Questions in Spec Delegation (Task 76)
- **Trigger**: User feedback on Task 76 (Final Revised Approach v3) delegation, pointing out that the instructions still resulted in the AI planning to ask questions about details already provided in the user's vision statement (e.g., "Can any team member submit?").
- **Context**: SPARC failed to properly instruct the `spec-pseudocode` mode to fully *interpret and incorporate* explicitly stated details from the user's vision into the draft requirements *before* formulating questions. Questions should only target genuine ambiguities or missing information.
- **Action Taken**: Halted task delegation. Logged intervention. Will re-delegate Task 76 with the strongest possible emphasis on incorporating existing details and asking *only* essential questions about unclear *intent*.
- **Rationale**: Prevent redundant questioning and ensure the AI leverages all provided context during the specification drafting process.
- **Outcome**: Intervention logged. Task 76 delegation instructions will be revised for the final time.
- **Follow-up**: SPARC must ensure delegation instructions explicitly tell modes to incorporate provided details and limit questions to essential ambiguities only.
