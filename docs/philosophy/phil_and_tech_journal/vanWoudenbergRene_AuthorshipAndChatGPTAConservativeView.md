## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can produce texts that mimic human writing. This raises questions about authorship: can ChatGPT be an author? We defend the conservative view that ChatGPT cannot be an author because it lacks the requisite normative and agential features. We argue that authorship involves responsibility, answerability, and desert, which ChatGPT cannot bear. We also argue that ChatGPT cannot perform illocutionary speech acts like promising or asserting, which are central to communication and authorship. We contrast the conservative view with liberal and moderate views, arguing that conservatism better explains our evaluative practices surrounding authorship without requiring controversial ontological commitments or revisions to our concept of authorship.

1 Introduction
--------------

Consider the following case:

> _Assignment_: Alice submitted a final paper that she’s proud of. She thinks that the argument is interesting, insightful, and that its conclusion is plausible. The teacher agrees: she gives Alice’s paper an A+ with the comments: “Amazing. I don’t know how to improve on this paper—I feel like I learned something interesting and important”.

The case features an evaluation. The teacher evaluates Alice’s paper as excellent. She could see its excellent features and even learned from the paper. There’s nothing astonishing or controversial about this kind of evaluation. _Of course_ some final papers are crafted so well that it moves the teacher to judge that the work is excellent. _Of course_ some papers are so careful, well argued, and insightful that we think it’s author must be experienced and talented. We all know this.

Now here’s the twist. Imagine that Alice is not responsible for the text; her creative writing played no role. Instead, ChatGPT produced the paper. Indeed, some ChatGPT produced works have gotten past expert blind-review (Else, [2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-024-00715-1#ref-CR9 "Else, H. (2023).

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/photographer-admits-prize-winning-image-was-ai-generated
")). But these decisions were all made without the evaluators knowing that ChatGPT was the author.[Footnote 1](#Fn1)

_Or was ChatGPT the author_? That’s our main question. Authorship and related concepts like ‘composer’, ‘poet’, ‘novelist’, and so forth all seem to encode information about creative, deliberative agency. What’s puzzling is that when we make epistemic, ethical, or aesthetic evaluations about texts, we often seem to be making evaluations about their authors. For Alice to be the author of her paper, didn’t she have to know or at least believe its content? But how could ChatGPT have the requisite knowledge or belief if it doesn’t even have mental states?

The _Assignment_ case helps to bring out certain other discursive expectations we have of authors as well. The teacher evaluated the essay epistemically, aesthetically, but also formally, namely, how well it met the criteria set out for the assignment (e.g., clarity, argumentation, creativity, structure). But then, supposing ChatGPT is the author, it must have _intended_ to meet the assignment’s criteria—or even exceed it. When we evaluate ‘Alice’s paper’ for excellence, our praise is directed at what _she authored_; her craftwork, creativity, and ability to meet the assignment’s standards. What’s more, we may turn to her for further explanation; we can ask her: “what did you mean here?” or “why did you write that?” and expect clarification, justification, and, if there was a mean statement in the text, regret. But with ChatGPT as the source, these expectations break down. What would it mean to praise ChatGPT for its effort, or expect remorse or compensation for its offense? How could we even demand a justification from ChatGPT?[Footnote 2](#Fn2) How could we expect compensation from _it_?

The _Assignment_ case reveals a puzzle, then. On the one hand, the evaluations of Alice, based on her submitted assignment, seem natural when there’s what we later call ‘normal authorship’, i.e. when she wrote the text herself. On the other hand, when we swap the author with ChatGPT, we can no longer make sense of such evaluative practices without error, confusion, or serious revision. For this is also puzzling. If there’s no difference in the texts produced but only their source, then perhaps our evaluations should remain; wouldn’t it be too rigid to take back our evaluations upon learning that the texts had an artificial (albeit arguably intelligent) source?

This puzzle might be thought to instance a more general problem. The relevant kinds of evaluations each seem to reflect properties that only _agents_, in their capacity as authors could possess. Authors have intentions, beliefs, reasons, expectations, and pieces of knowledge, which facilitate the creation of their work. Moreover, authors can be morally or epistemically responsible for their work; they can be praiseworthy or blameworthy for failing to attend to the relevant evidence, or praised for their acute perceptiveness, for example. In general, they are answerable to others for their authorship. But with ChatGPT as the source of the relevant texts, there’s just no clear agent (or something agential) to bear the benefit (or the burden) of our evaluations. This creates an _attributability gap_, echoing similar worries about responsibility gaps for AI in general (see Santoni de Sio & Mecacci, [2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-024-00715-1#ref-CR27 "Santoni de Sio, F., & Mecacci, G. (2021). Four responsibility gaps with artificial intelligence: Why they matter and how to address them. Philosophy and Technology, 34, 1057–1084.")).[Footnote 3](#Fn3)

(2021). Four responsibility gaps with artificial intelligence: Why they matter and how to address them. Philosophy and Technology, 34, 1057–1084.")).[Footnote 3](#Fn3)

How should we respond? Some might argue that the relevant kinds of evaluations of texts all require normal authorship and so a certain kind of agency, but that ChatGPT lacks agency, rendering our initial (pre-reveal) verdict about Alice strictly mistaken. Call this the _conservative view_. Roughly put, the argument for the conservative view is that our evaluations are fundamentally about properties traceable to authorship, and that claims to authorship stick only when certain mental states and normative capacities are present. That’s what’s missing in the case of ChatGPT textual production, however, and so it doesn’t really ‘author’ anything. _Mutatis Mutandis_ for any other LLM currently lacking strong general artificial intelligence.

However, others might contend that, in light of the emergence of sophisticated LLMs, such as ChatGPT-4 or models like Microsoft and Meta’s Llama 2 (utilized in platforms like Azure and Windows, or PaLM which powers Google’s chatbot Bard), that we must revise our views of authorship. Although initially we may have thought that only human beings could author novels, essays, poetry, grants, or research articles, LLMs force us to question this thought and so the attendant presuppositions which underly it. Perhaps ChatGPT _intended_ to satisfy the requirements for an A-grade. Maybe ChatGPT _knew_ or had _justification to believe_ that, say, its research proposal would be competitive. And so on. Call this the _liberal view_.[Footnote 4](#Fn4) The argument for the liberal view, in a nutshell, is that it can parsimoniously account for ordinary language surrounding AI.[Footnote 5](#Fn5) Consider the seeming propriety of statement _(A)_ “You didn’t author that essay, ChatGPT did”. The truth-conditions of this sentence seem to be that there is something which authored an essay, that it is ChatGPT, and that if it is ChatGPT, then it wasn’t you. If the conservative view is correct, then _(A)_ is false, because ChatGPT simply lacks the properties and capacities necessary for authorship. So, assuming the propriety of statements like _(A)_, the conservative view faces the burden of explaining or dispelling the propriety of _(A)_. On the liberal view, by contrast, _(A)_’s propriety needs no explanation. (We will present the conservative’s account of _(A)_’s propriety in §5.)

Between the conservative and the liberal there is a _moderate view_ according to which conservatives are wrong to think that ChatGPT and other new deep learning AI aren’t authors, but that the liberals are wrong to think that ChatGPT and its kin should be attributed mental state-types of the sort routinely ascribed to humans, like knowledge, belief, intention, and so forth. In turn, they’ll deny that ChatGPT bears knowledge-, belief-, or intention-entailing relations, like promising, assertion, or assurance as well.[Footnote 6](#Fn6)

The main argument for the moderate view is that it avoids the psychological sectarianism of the conservative view and the ontological excesses of the liberal view. In due course, we’ll explore in some detail how moderates might defend this claim, but as a rough preview, moderates can say that we should adopt the ‘intentional stance’ towards ChatGPT, and thereby treat ChatGPT _as if_ it had beliefs, knowledge, and intentions; or else moderates could give a _functional_ account of what performs authorship-roles, so that authorship only requires performing certain functions, like generating a text that is coherent, contextually appropriate, and even novel, or otherwise enrich our conception of authorship without taking on the burdens of either conservative or liberal ontology (see, e.g., Floridi, [2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-024-00715-1#ref-CR11 "Floridi, L. (2023). AI as agency without intelligence: On ChatGPT, large language models, and other generative models. Philosophy & Technology, 36(15), 1–7. 
https://doi.org/10.1007/s13347-023-00621-y
")).

We argue in favor of the conservative view. Conservatives must explain the apparent propriety of statements like _(A)_ without demanding retraction or serious changes in the concept of authorship. Moreover, conservatives need to explain why liberals and the moderates aren’t right and they should do so without succumbing to AI-chauvinism or a romantic vision of the human person. That’s what we try do in this paper. In turn, the conservative view doesn’t demand _skepticism about AI_, specifically that AI cannot in principle be an author, an agent, a knower, and so forth.

Our argument proceeds as follows. First, we outline some preliminaries about ChatGPT and authorship (§2). Second, we detail what we call ‘normal writing’ which we argue, is undetachable from agency and its normative features (§3). This leads us to the epistemic and practical functions of authorship-ascriptions, which we argue are agency-entailing, with a certain mental state ontology (e.g., belief, desire, intention, knowledge) (§4). We then zoom in on relevant cases, like promising and assertion, which we argue ChatGPT is incapable of performing (§5), before considering the shortcomings of the liberal and moderate views (§6). We conclude with some considerations about deep-learning AI and open-questions about epistemic attributability gaps.

2 Preliminaries
---------------

What is ChatGPT? It is a deep learning natural language AI system that generates something that reads like a human-written text. Let us say neutrally that it ‘generates texts’.[Footnote 7](#Fn7) And it does so given certain instructions and prompts that users prompt the system with. For example, the prompt “Tell me about Martin Luther King” may generate a textual output with key facts about Martin Luther King, or major events involving Martin Luther King.

Two things about ChatGPT are especially important to keep in mind. First, as Stephen Wolfram explains, “what ChatGPT is always fundamentally trying to do is to produce a ‘reasonable continuation’ of whatever text it’s got so far, where by ‘reasonable’ we mean ‘what one might expect someone to write after seeing what people have written on billions of webpages, etc.”[Footnote 8](#Fn8) In other words, what ChatGPT is essentially doing is ‘asking’, over and over again “given the text so far, what should the next word be?”, and each time adding a word. The ‘answer’ is based on the calculated probability that the next word in the sequence _ABC_ (where _A_, _B_ and _C_ are words) is _D_.

Second, even if ChatGPT produces a sentence that is true, it is not necessarily ‘aiming’ at truth. By this we mean that even if the output sentences are true, or the output text as a whole is accurate, this is an unintended by-product of ChatGPT’s computations. Truth is not a design principle of ChatGPT, as it was of the SHRDLU AI system. Of course, whether this means that relying on ChatGPT-generated texts for belief renders the corresponding belief unjustified, irrational, or incapable of producing knowledge is a further question.

3 The Conservative View
-----------------------

### 3.1 Normal Writing

What is the connection between writing and authorship?[Footnote 9](#Fn9) We begin by discussing the nature and normativity of what we call ‘normal writing’. Normal writing has the mark of intentionality. It is an _intentional_ action in five different senses.[Footnote 10](#Fn10) Writing is, first, an intentional action, i.e. it is not due to chance, it isn’t a fluke or a coincidence that one writes when one writes. Persons who write normally have the intention, even the conscious intention, _to_ write. When one is executing an _intended_ action, one normally _knows_ what one is doing.

But things aren’t always normal. We use the qualifier ‘normal’ to accommodate two phenomena: (a) Deeply confused persons who write without having the intention _to_ write. (b) There is also writing in trance, or under hypnosis. These are clear exceptions to what normally is the case when one is writing.

Second, writing is normally also intentional in that authors intend to write about _something in particular_. Normally people who write know _what_ they are writing about—about the latest Nobel Prizes, for instance, or about Darwin’s voyage on the Beagle.

The ‘normality’ qualifier accommodates (c) cases of deeply confused person who may know that they are writing, even if they have no idea what they are writing about. (d) Cases of people involved in forms of _écriture automatique_, i.e. people who know they are writing, but do so without conscious policing their thoughts, without letting what they write be influenced by morality or by what is politically correct.[Footnote 11](#Fn11)

A third way in which writing is intentional is that it is normally directed at others, it _targets other persons_. When one writes, one normally wants to communicate something to others: what one writes is normally _addressed_. The address can be a very specific person, or a well-defined set of persons, but also less well-defined groups, and even only merely _hoped-for_ readers.

The ‘normally’ qualifier also accommodates (e) cases of exercising one’s writing hand or typing skills and so writing _without addressing anybody_ and (f) cases of making notes for oneself only, and so not targeting other persons, but oneself at a later time. Normally, however, when one is writing there are _others_ who are targeted.

Writing is furthermore intentional in that it is normally _about_ things. What we write is normally about something, like, politics, poetry, or psychiatric disorders. The products of normal writing, texts, have what Franz Brentano called intentionality: they have _about-ness_.

The ‘normally’ qualifier also accommodates (g) cases of confused writing that are not about anything due to a psychological condition like Alzheimer’s disease and (h) cases of delightful nonsense poetry that lack propositional content.

A final way in which writing is normally intentional is that _through_ writing, persons normally attain, and intend to attain, aims that are external to the writing. For example, writers intend to inform their readers, motivate them, interrogate them, warn them, entertain them, etc. Normally writers have illocutionary and perlocutionary intentions.

The qualifier accommodates cases of writing without intending any effect in possible readers; the writing _is_ an end in itself, performed “just for the fun of it”. Putting these points together we define ‘normal writing’ as follows:

> A piece of writing _W_ is ‘normal’ when: (i) there is an author who intentionally writes _W_, i.e. knows _that_ they are writing; (ii) the author intends to write (about) something in particular, i.e. knows _what_ they are writing; (iii) the author addresses or targets a readership with _W_; (iv) _W_ has intentionality; (v) the author intends to secure some effect in their readership through _W_.[Footnote 12](#Fn12)

But something should be added. St. Bonaventure called an _auctor_ someone who writes “his own words”. He distinguished _auctors_, from _scriptors_ (i.e. someone who copies texts), from _compilers_ (i.e. someone who puts passages together from texts that are not his own), and from _exegetes_ (i.e. someone who adds his own words to the words of others.) It seems clear that neither scriptors nor compilers, although they write, are authors, since they don’t engage in normal writing. For normal writing requires, to use Bonaventure’s phrase, that one writes one’s own words. We could put this as follows: someone’s writing is normal writing when the writer is the content owner of the writing. This must be added as element (vi) to the definition of normal writing. For the purposes of this paper, we assume that (i), (ii), (iv), and (vi) are essential to normal writing, whereas (iii) and (v), strictly speaking, although they are usually present in normal writing, are not. Given this explication, we now define an author as someone who engages in, or has engaged in, normal writing.

### 3.2 Forms of Authorship

There are various ways in which people can engage in normal writing. One way is to write out the text oneself, through handwriting, keyboard input, or voice-to-text, as when one dictates a short text to the note app in their phone.

Secondly, there is what Nicholas Wolterstorff has called authorial ‘superintendence’,[Footnote 13](#Fn13) a phenomenon that comes in degrees: there is dictation to a secretary, which may be a line-by-line voice-to-text production, or close to it, with superfluous and pausing words like ‘um’ or ‘uh’ omitted; next a mere indication of substance to a secretary (e.g., “Tell them that there is a meeting tomorrow morning when we get in” becomes the text “Dear development team, there is a meeting tomorrow are 9:00 a.m.”); next there is writing by a secretary without such indication as when the secretary ‘knows the mind’ of the executive, and who accordingly qualifies as the author.

Third, there is also authorship by what Wolterstorff calls ‘authorization’: appropriating someone else’s text, letting it serve as a medium for one’s own communication.[Footnote 14](#Fn14) Examples like the following make this plausible. If a snail on the beach leaves a trace behind that reads like the sentence “I love you”, then if you see that snail produce that trail, you wouldn’t believe that you are reading a declaration of love. But if you next see that your partner adds the words to the sand “Really! —Elizabeth”, then you normally would believe that. Or suppose you feel down and full of self-doubt and while shopping, you see a reck of gift cards that carry texts like “You can do it!” and “You’re awesome!” then normally wouldn’t feel encouraged, or reassured. Such effects, normally, can only be hoped for when such cards are signed by someone you know, and who appropriates the text.[Footnote 15](#Fn15)

### 3.3 Functions of the Ascription of Authorship

What does the concept of ‘author(ship)’ allow us to do? Why do we talk about authorship, and what are the functions of ascriptions of authorship?

The core function of the concept of ‘author’ is that it allows us to assign responsibility to someone for the existence and content of the text. And this, in turn, allows users of the concept of ‘author’ to do at least five things.[Footnote 16](#Fn16) First, as noted above, on the basis of what the recipients read, it allows them to ground an evaluative assessment of the author. It allows them to say that the author was correct or mistaken, convincing or not, etc. Ascription of authorship thus play what Fischer and Ravizza call the ‘ledger function’, which functions to track and maintain a report on authors. This helps us to make more general normative evaluations of authors, as when a critic reviews ‘the work’ of a novelist rather than a single text.[Footnote 17](#Fn17)

Second, as we have flagged in our discussion of _Assignment_, the concept of ‘author’ allows us to determine who must be able to explain and justify what is written. The notion of an author thus plays what has been called an ‘answerability function’.[Footnote 18](#Fn18)—This enables us to identify who ought to provide answers to questions readers might have about what the text is supposed to mean, or about why what it says is supposed to be justified.

Although the answerability function and the ledger function may sometimes overlap, they are not the same. The role of the answerability function is not to evaluate authors as such, but to help us keep track of who should answer for a text, who must be held responsible for explaining and justifying its content.

Third, the concept of ‘author’ enables us to determine what treatment the person who wrote the text is due, what, given what they wrote, would be just or fair responses. The concept thus plays a ‘desert function’. Given the content of the text, an author may deserve praise, or deserve a grant or even the Pulitzer Prize, but they may also deserve derision, polite silence, or even punishment.

Fourth, the concept of ‘author’ enables us to determine how serious the message/content of the text should be taken. If we can reliably identify _S_ as the author of a text, this enables us to evaluate how seriously we should take the text. If _S_ is the President of the United States and their text declares war on Iraq, then we should take this much more seriously than if _S_ is your little niece. Certain professional roles, then, can further enrich the role of authorship in a given context, as authors may have institutional positions that can lend authority to their writing, as Presidential declarations, professional medical reports, or legal judgments do. This we call the ‘gravity discerning function’ of the concept of author.

Fifth and finally, the concept enables us to determine who should be compensated, or who should compensate others, because of the text. Authorship contracts specify receivers of royalties. And in case the text is offensive to third parties, it enables us to specify who will have to compensate for damages, be it an apology, a retraction, or financial compensation. This ‘compensation function’ is especially prominent in legal contexts, when the texts instance libel, plagiarism, false rumors, or outright lies.

4 ChatGPT and Authorship
------------------------

In light of what we have said about normal writing and authorship, we now turn to ChatGPT and address a number of related questions.

### 4.1 Do ChatGPT Generated Texts Have Authors?

The basic conservative argument is this:

> P1. If ChatGPT authors its texts, then it has the normative, agency-entailing features relevant for author functions.
> 
> P2. But ChatGPT lacks the normative, agency-entailing features relevant for author functions.

Therefore,

> C. It’s not the case that ChatGPT authors its texts.

It follows that ChatGPT is not an author since there are no other texts for which ChatGPT stands a chance at authoring beside the texts it produces.
