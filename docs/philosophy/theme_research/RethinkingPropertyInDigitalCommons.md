# **Digital Commons: Rethinking Property in Information Space**

## **I. Introduction: The Shifting Landscape of Property in the Digital Age**

The advent of digital technologies and networked communication has profoundly reshaped economies, societies, and the very nature of information itself. Central to this transformation is the emergence of the "digital commons"—vast reservoirs of shared online resources encompassing data, information, culture, and knowledge.1 These commons are often created and maintained collectively, operating outside the traditional logics of market exchange or state administration, representing a potential "third way" of organizing societal resources.1 Their significance lies not only in their content but also in their role as foundational elements for innovation, communication, social organization, and potentially, new forms of public digital infrastructure.1 The concept of the digital commons is crucial for fostering equitable access and countering the increasing trend towards the legal enclosure of information and culture.1

However, the digital commons differ fundamentally from the tangible commons studied historically. Traditional common-pool resources, like forests or fisheries, are typically characterized by rivalry (one person's use diminishes availability for others) and non-excludability (difficulty in preventing access).6 Digital resources, by contrast, are generally non-rivalrous: one person's use of a piece of software, a dataset, or a digital text does not deplete it for others.1 Indeed, their value may even increase with wider use (anti-rivalry or network effects). This inherent shareability, coupled with the near-zero cost of reproduction and distribution in digital formats, presents a fundamental challenge to established theories of property, which were largely conceived in an era dominated by scarce, rivalrous, physical goods.8 The ease of copying troubles traditional justifications for intellectual property (IP) protection, creating an "asymmetry in attitudes" 8 and forcing a reconsideration of ownership norms developed for tangible assets. Consequently, the governance challenges for digital commons shift away from managing resource scarcity towards ensuring sustainability against threats like under-supply of maintenance, inadequate legal frameworks, pollution (such as the proliferation of misinformation), lack of quality or findability, and various forms of enclosure.1

This report undertakes a comprehensive philosophical and theoretical analysis of how concepts of property, value, and governance are being rethought in response to the unique characteristics of the digital commons. It aims to dissect the challenges posed to classical property theories, explore alternative conceptual frameworks, investigate contemporary battlegrounds like Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and synthesize diverse philosophical traditions to envision more just and sustainable approaches to managing information resources. The structure proceeds as follows: Section II examines the legacy of Lockean property theory and its limitations in the digital sphere. Section III delves into Marxist critiques of property as applied to information capitalism, including the influential concept of "the common" developed by Hardt and Negri. Section IV compares Elinor Ostrom's principles for governing tangible commons with attempts to govern digital resources through DAOs and blockchain. Section V explores the complex ethical and ownership questions raised by AI-generated content and training data. Section VI synthesizes insights from analytic and continental philosophy to address issues of digital justice, equity, and access, with a particular focus on the predicament of the Global South. Section VII analyzes the overall strengths, weaknesses, and practical governance challenges facing the digital commons. Finally, Section VIII offers concluding reflections on the ongoing transformation of property in the information age.

## **II. Lockean Legacies and Digital Dilemmas**

John Locke's theory of property, articulated primarily in his *Second Treatise of Government*, has profoundly influenced Western legal and political thought, often serving as a cornerstone justification for private property rights within classical liberalism.12 Understanding its premises and limitations is crucial for evaluating its applicability—and the challenges it faces—in the context of intangible digital goods.

### **Revisiting Locke: Labor, Appropriation, and the Proviso**

Locke's argument for the original acquisition of property begins with the premise of self-ownership: every individual owns their own person and, consequently, their own labor.13 The earth and its resources are initially given to humankind in common.16 An individual can justly remove resources from this common state and make them their private property by "mixing" their labor with them.13 This act of labor adds value and establishes a claim to the object, transforming it from common to private.16 Locke posits that this process allows individuals to unilaterally change the moral landscape by creating property rights independent of the consent of others, providing a sphere for autonomous action.13 The primary function of government, in this view, is to protect these acquired rights to life, liberty, and estate (property).13

However, this right of appropriation is not unlimited. Locke introduces two crucial provisos. First, the "non-waste" proviso dictates that one may only appropriate what one can use before it spoils; allowing resources to perish unused is an offense against the common stock.13 Second, the famous "enough and as good" proviso requires that in appropriating resources from the commons, one must leave "enough, and as good" remaining for others.13 When this condition is met, the appropriation effectively harms no one, akin to taking a drink from a river that leaves sufficient water for those downstream.16 Some interpretations suggest Locke might assent to an "intellectual commons" – the realm of ideas and knowledge – analogous to the physical commons, given that God endowed humans with mental capacities to grasp and use intellectual property for their support and comfort.16

### **Non-Rivalry and the Limits of Lockean Justification for IP**

The application of Lockean theory to justify intellectual property rights (IPRs) hinges significantly on the nature of intellectual goods, particularly their non-rivalry. Proponents argue that creating an intellectual work (like an invention or a piece of writing) inherently satisfies the "enough and as good" proviso because ideas, unlike land or physical objects, are not depleted by use.8 My use of your idea does not prevent you or anyone else from using it simultaneously.8 Therefore, appropriating an idea through creation does not seem to diminish the common stock of potential ideas available to others. Some Lockeans contend that IP easily passes both the "enough and as good" and the "non-waste" provisions (arguing future uses make waste implausible).16 This non-rivalrous nature appears to make intellectual property less problematic than physical property under a Lockean framework, suggesting it is not a zero-sum game where one person's gain necessitates another's loss.8 Furthermore, the labor theory provides a seemingly intuitive justification: creators invest significant intellectual effort and deserve to own the fruits of that labor, grounding IPRs in natural rights rather than mere state-granted monopolies or utilitarian incentives.8

However, this line of reasoning faces significant challenges. Critics argue that while the *idea* itself is non-rivalrous, the *legal rights* granted by IP systems (like patents and copyrights) create artificial scarcity by granting the owner the power to exclude others.10 This exclusion prevents others from freely using, sharing, and building upon the protected knowledge or expression. If the baseline for comparison is a state where the intellectual commons is freely accessible, then imposing IP restrictions arguably *does* violate the spirit of the Lockean proviso by worsening the position of others – denying them access to resources they could otherwise have used.10 The focus on non-depletion overlooks the harm caused by restricted access and use. Therefore, the argument that non-rivalry automatically satisfies the proviso might be a superficial application, failing to grapple with the socially constructed scarcity imposed by IP regimes. This tension highlights a potential conflict: while Locke aimed to justify appropriation that leaves others unharmed, IP rights, by their nature, restrict access to non-rivalrous goods, potentially hindering rather than promoting the overall availability of knowledge and creative works.

Further conceptual difficulties arise. The very idea of "mixing labor" with intangible, abstract objects like ideas or information is arguably metaphorical at best and incoherent at worst.10 Unlike tilling land, one cannot physically combine labor with an abstract concept. Additionally, the scope of modern IP rights often seems inconsistent with Lockean principles. For instance, Lockean property rights are typically considered indefinite unless the property is wasted or abandoned, yet copyrights and patents have fixed expiration dates.16 Conversely, patent law excludes independent inventors from using their own creations if someone else patented the idea first, which seems contrary to a labor-based justification that should reward individual effort regardless of who was first.16

### **Philosophical Reformulations and Critiques**

In response to these difficulties, scholars have sought to refine or reformulate Lockean theory for the intellectual sphere. One interpretation posits that labor does not automatically grant full ownership but rather creates a *prima facie* or presumptive claim to the object.8 The proviso then functions as a condition determining whether this initial claim becomes a morally binding right that imposes duties of non-interference on others.8 This view often incorporates a Paretian understanding of the proviso: an appropriation is justified if it makes no one worse off than they were in the state of nature (or potentially makes everyone better off).8 This framing seeks to justify IP by arguing that the benefits of incentivizing creation outweigh any potential downsides of restricted access, thus satisfying the non-worsening condition.

A particularly interesting reformulation argues that Lockean principles apply *more* plausibly to copyright than to physical property.9 This argument rests on the non-rivalrous and *transformable* nature of expressive works. Unlike physical objects, where appropriation by the first laborer inherently excludes subsequent laborers (the "first laborer" problem), intellectual works allow for multiple claims to coexist.9 Because expression is non-rivalrous, an independent creator who arrives at a similar work without copying is not barred from their own creation (the independent creation defense in copyright).9 Furthermore, because expression is transformable, subsequent authors can build upon existing works (through commentary, parody, criticism – often protected by fair use) to create new, original expressions based on their own labor.9 Both the original and the transformative author can hold rights based on their respective labor, avoiding the zero-sum conflict inherent in rivalrous physical property.

However, this more plausible Lockean justification for copyright leads to the perhaps surprising conclusion that copyright protection should be *more limited* than current law provides.9 If the justification rests on rewarding the author's specific labor in creating an expression, it supports strong protection for transformative uses (as expressions of the subsequent author's labor) and undermines rights that extend beyond the author's direct contribution. Specifically, it calls into question the copyright owner's exclusive right to control *derivative works* (like translations or adaptations), arguing that this right improperly grants the original author control over the subsequent labor of others who transform the work.9 It also casts doubt on moral rights of integrity (protecting a work from alteration), as these attach to the physical embodiment and thus reintroduce the problems of rivalrous goods.9 Thus, a consistent Lockean copyright theory, focused on non-rivalry and transformability, paradoxically supports limitations like fair use and challenges expansive rights like the derivative right, contrasting sharply with interpretations that use Locke to argue for strong, broad IP protection.19

Finally, some critiques challenge the inherent bias within traditional Lockeanism towards private property.17 This bias assumes privatization is the default and often overlooks or delegitimizes existing common property systems.17 Modified approaches, like "ambidextrous Lockeanism," propose that the core Lockean concern for autonomy could justify a wider spectrum of property arrangements, including common ownership and governance structures, potentially offering a more flexible framework for analyzing digital commons.17

## **III. Marxist Perspectives on Information Capitalism and the Common**

Marxist theory offers a fundamentally different lens through which to analyze property, focusing on its role within capitalist relations of production, exploitation, and alienation. Applying these concepts to the digital age reveals critical insights into information capitalism, the nature of digital labor, and the potential significance of collaborative production models like those found in the digital commons.

### **Marx's Critique of Property in the Context of Digital Labor and Value**

At the heart of Marx's critique lies the assertion that private ownership of the means of production is the basis for the exploitation of labor under capitalism.21 Society is understood through the interplay of the *forces of production* (technology, labor power, knowledge) and the *relations of production* (ownership structures, class relations).22 Value, in classical Marxist terms, is determined by the *socially necessary labor time* required to produce a commodity.23 Capitalists extract *surplus value* by paying workers less than the value their labor creates, the difference arising from labor time performed beyond what is necessary to reproduce the workers' own subsistence.21 This process inherently involves class struggle between the owners of capital and the proletariat.21 It also leads to *alienation*, where workers are separated from the products of their labor, the process of labor itself, their own human potential ("species-being"), and their fellow humans.22

The rise of "information capitalism" or "informationalism" 21—where knowledge, data, communication, and intellectual work become increasingly central to economic activity 22—poses complex questions for this framework. A major debate concerns Marx's labor theory of value.23 Since digital information can be reproduced almost instantaneously at negligible cost, the socially necessary labor time for its *reproduction* approaches zero.23 Some argue this undermines the labor theory of value in the context of information goods, suggesting that value generation must operate differently in the digital sphere.23

However, alternative Marxist interpretations maintain the relevance of the value framework. One view emphasizes that while information itself may have near-zero *value* in the strict Marxist sense (determined by reproduction time), it plays a crucial role in the production of *relative surplus value* across the economy.23 By incorporating information—in the form of software, data analytics, process innovations, scientific knowledge—into production processes, capitalists can dramatically increase labor productivity, reduce the necessary labor time required to produce other goods, and thereby increase the rate of surplus value extraction.23

Another perspective focuses on the exploitation inherent in *digital labor*. This includes not only the paid labor of software developers, designers, and other "information workers" 23 but also the often unpaid labor performed by users of social media platforms, search engines, and other online services.21 Users generate data, create content, build networks, and engage in interactions that are captured and monetized by platform owners, constituting a form of surplus labor extraction or the creation of an "audience commodity".27

Furthermore, the concept of *rent* becomes central.23 Since information itself has negligible value, the profits derived from it often stem not from selling the commodity at its value, but from charging for access based on monopolies created by intellectual property rights (copyrights, patents, trademarks) or trade secrets.23 These IP regimes allow owners to extract "information rent"—a portion of the surplus value generated elsewhere in the economy—by controlling access to crucial information assets.23 This perspective casts owners of large digital platforms or extensive IP portfolios as "digital landlords" engaged primarily in rent-seeking activities rather than direct value production.27 This analysis reveals a central paradox: information's near-zero reproduction cost makes it difficult to directly commodify based on labor value, yet its immense utility in boosting productivity and its susceptibility to monopolization via IP make it a critical engine for capital accumulation through relative surplus value and rent extraction.

### **Hardt and Negri's "Common": Application to FOSS and Collaborative Knowledge**

Building on autonomist Marxist traditions 26, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri offer a powerful framework for understanding contemporary global capitalism and resistance through concepts like *Empire* (a decentralized, global network of sovereignty) and the *Multitude* (the collective, diverse social subject whose labor sustains Empire).26 Central to their analysis is the rise of *immaterial labor*—labor producing information, knowledge, affects, communication, and social relationships—as increasingly hegemonic, shaping other forms of production and social life.26

Hardt and Negri conceptualize "the common" as the shared wealth produced by the multitude, particularly through immaterial labor.26 This common includes not just tangible resources but also, crucially, knowledge, ideas, code, language, images, and affects—the very fabric of social life and communication.26 The common is constantly generated through collaboration and interaction, often outside direct capitalist control.26 However, a key dynamic of contemporary capitalism ("Empire") is the continuous *capture* and *privatization* of this common.26 Capital subsumes the products of collective intelligence and cooperation, transforming living labor and shared knowledge into "dead labor" embedded in commodities or controlled assets.26

This framework provides a valuable lens for analyzing phenomena like Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities and large-scale collaborative knowledge projects such as Wikipedia.22 These initiatives exemplify the production of the common: they rely on networked collaboration, shared knowledge inputs, and often produce resources intended for broad access and use, operating according to principles of openness and peer governance rather than hierarchical control or market exchange.22 They represent, potentially, alternative modes of production that challenge capitalist relations based on private ownership and exclusion.22 However, these commons are not immune to capitalist dynamics. Corporations heavily utilize and profit from FOSS, often without contributing proportionally to its maintenance (a point echoed in discussions of the "Tragedy of the Digital Commons" 5). Collaborative platforms are frequently owned by private entities that extract value from user contributions.3 Thus, the digital common becomes a site of struggle between the productive forces of the multitude and capital's attempts at enclosure and value extraction.22 Critiques exist regarding the actual democratic nature of some FOSS projects or the potential for co-option 28, and some challenge Hardt and Negri's specific claims, such as the supposed demise of Marx's law of value 23 or their potential overestimation of the multitude's autonomous power.31

### **The 'General Intellect' and Collective Production Online**

Marx's concept of the "general intellect," introduced in the *Grundrisse*, resonates strongly with contemporary discussions of digital production.22 Marx foresaw a stage of capitalism where "general social knowledge" – the accumulated scientific knowledge, technological skill, and cooperative capacities of society – becomes the principal force of production, diminishing the importance of direct labor time as the measure of wealth.22 He envisioned this general intellect as a form of commons, residing "in whose head exists the accumulated knowledge of society," potentially undermining capital's control and blowing its foundations "sky high".34

The digital age arguably brings this concept to life in unprecedented ways.34 The internet, networked computing, and collaborative platforms provide the infrastructure for the rapid creation, storage, dissemination, and collective application of knowledge and skill on a global scale.34 FOSS projects, Wikipedia, open science initiatives, and even the vast communicative activity on social networks can be seen as manifestations of the general intellect at work – collective intelligence producing shared resources.22 This collective production, often driven by non-market motivations like collaboration, reputation, or use-value, embodies the emancipatory potential Marx associated with the general intellect.22

However, just as Hardt and Negri emphasize the capture of the common, Marxist analysis highlights how capital seeks to harness, control, and commodify the general intellect.25 Platforms are designed to extract data and value from collective online activity.3 Intellectual property laws are employed to enclose collaboratively produced knowledge.35 Automation driven by collective data aims to replace human labor.25 Thus, FOSS and other collaborative online projects are not simply technological phenomena but crucial sites of political and economic contestation. They represent both the potential for post-capitalist forms of production based on shared knowledge (the common/general intellect) and the targets for new forms of capitalist enclosure, exploitation, and alienation in the information age.22

## **IV. Governing the Commons: Ostrom, DAOs, and Decentralized Futures**

While Lockean and Marxist theories grapple with the fundamental nature of property and value in the digital realm, the practical question of how to effectively govern shared digital resources remains paramount. Elinor Ostrom's work on governing tangible common-pool resources provides a crucial empirical foundation, while the rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represents a contemporary technological attempt to implement commons governance principles in the digital sphere.

### **Elinor Ostrom's Design Principles for Sustainable Commons**

Challenging the prevailing assumption that common resources inevitably lead to a "Tragedy of the Commons" requiring either state control or privatization 17, Elinor Ostrom demonstrated through extensive empirical research that communities across the world have successfully self-governed shared resources for long periods.7 Her Nobel Prize-winning work identified key institutional characteristics, known as design principles, associated with these robust, long-enduring common-pool resource (CPR) management systems.39 These principles are not a rigid blueprint but rather a set of conditions commonly found in successful cases:

1. **Clearly Defined Boundaries:** The boundaries of the resource system and the individuals or households with rights to access and use the resource are clearly defined.11  
2. **Congruence with Local Conditions:** Appropriation and provision rules are adapted to the specific local social and environmental conditions, ensuring a match between rules and the resource system's needs.41  
3. **Collective-Choice Arrangements:** Most individuals affected by the operational rules can participate in modifying them, ensuring that rules remain relevant and legitimate to the users.41  
4. **Monitoring:** Monitors, who may be resource users themselves or accountable to them, actively audit resource conditions and user behavior.41  
5. **Graduated Sanctions:** Resource users who violate operational rules are likely to face graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and context of the offense) imposed by other users, officials accountable to users, or both.41  
6. **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms:** Resource users and their officials have access to low-cost, local arenas for resolving conflicts among users or between users and officials.41  
7. **Minimal Recognition of Rights to Organize:** The rights of resource users to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities.41  
8. **Nested Enterprises:** Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises, allowing for governance to scale.41

Ostrom's work emphasized the importance of self-organization, trust, and context-specific rules, often highlighting the effectiveness of *polycentric governance*—systems with multiple, overlapping centers of decision-making that cooperate and compete within an overarching set of rules—as a viable alternative to monocentric state or market control.7

### **DAOs and Blockchain Governance: A Comparative Analysis with Ostrom**

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have emerged as a novel organizational form, leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and token-based systems to enable collective action and governance, often with the explicit aim of decentralization.39 Proponents suggest DAOs offer a technological means to implement principles similar to Ostrom's for governing digital commons.39

The potential alignment between Ostrom's principles and DAO mechanisms can be analyzed as follows:

| Ostrom's Design Principle | Potential DAO/Blockchain Implementation | Challenges & Limitations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Clearly Defined Boundaries** | Token gating (access/voting rights tied to token holding); Smart contract permissions defining roles and actions.41 | Defining meaningful membership beyond token holding; Sybil attacks (multiple identities); Fluidity of online participation. |
| **2\. Congruence/Local Conditions** | Governance rules encoded in smart contracts; Adaptability through community proposals and code updates.41 | Code rigidity ("code is law"); Difficulty capturing nuanced local context in formal rules; Technical barriers to proposing/implementing changes; Ensuring rules match diverse global needs. |
| **3\. Collective-Choice** | On-chain or off-chain voting systems (e.g., Snapshot); Proposal forums; Token-weighted or reputation-based voting.43 | Voter apathy and low participation 37; Plutocracy/Oligarchy due to token concentration ("whales") 37; Quality of deliberation vs. speed; Complexity of mechanisms. |
| **4\. Monitoring** | Public ledger transparency; Automated monitoring via smart contracts; Event logs on-chain.41 | Information overload; Difficulty monitoring off-chain behavior; Technical expertise needed to interpret blockchain data; Privacy concerns with full transparency. |
| **5\. Graduated Sanctions** | Automated token slashing; Reputation score adjustments; Smart contract-based exclusion; Dispute resolution outcomes.41 | Lack of nuance/context in automated sanctions; Potential for disproportionate punishment; Difficulty enforcing sanctions for off-chain actions; Gaming of reputation systems. |
| **6\. Conflict Resolution** | Decentralized arbitration platforms (e.g., Kleros, Aragon Court); On-chain dispute resolution protocols.41 | Scalability of dispute resolution; Enforcement of rulings; Legitimacy and fairness concerns; Cost and complexity of participation. |
| **7\. Minimal Recognition of Rights** | Aim for autonomy via code; Legal ambiguity; Efforts to create legal wrappers (e.g., LLCs, associations).43 | Lack of widespread legal recognition for DAOs as autonomous entities; Regulatory uncertainty and potential government intervention; Conflicts between code and law. |
| **8\. Nested Enterprises** | SubDAOs; Multi-signature wallets managing specific functions; Potential for federated structures; Interoperability protocols.41 | Complexity of managing multiple layers; Coordination challenges between nested units; Ensuring alignment with overall DAO goals; Technical interoperability hurdles. |

This comparison reveals that while blockchain technology offers novel tools—transparency through public ledgers, automation via smart contracts, new ways to define boundaries and rights via tokens—these technical solutions do not automatically guarantee successful commons governance.41 The core challenges often remain social, political, and economic.

### **Challenges of Scale, Heterogeneity, and the 'Ownership Problem' in Digital Governance**

Applying Ostrom's principles, derived from relatively small-scale, often geographically bounded communities with shared norms and high levels of interaction 7, to the vast, global, diverse, and often anonymous or pseudonymous communities of the digital realm presents significant hurdles.42 Scaling participation in decision-making becomes immensely difficult when communities number in the millions.42 Achieving congruence requires navigating extreme cultural and contextual diversity.42 Monitoring behavior and applying graduated sanctions effectively is complicated by anonymity and the lack of shared social fabric.44 The cognitive limits on maintaining stable social relationships, as suggested by Dunbar's number, imply that governance based purely on direct trust and interaction cannot easily scale to the size of many online communities or DAOs.45

A fundamental challenge, particularly highlighted when contrasting with Ostrom's emphasis on community control, is the "ownership problem" of digital governance.39 Many digital commons and DAOs rely on underlying infrastructure—servers, cloud hosting, software platforms, internet protocols—that is owned and controlled by centralized private entities or consortia.39 This dependency creates a vulnerability: the owners of the infrastructure can impose rules, extract value, censor activity, or even shut down the space, undermining the community's autonomy and capacity for self-governance.39 This contradicts Ostrom's seventh principle regarding the right to organize without external interference.

Blockchain and DAOs are often presented as solutions to this ownership problem by enabling decentralized infrastructure and stakeholder-governed organizations.39 The idea of "common DAOs" running on collectively owned infrastructure aims to directly address this issue.39 However, the practical reality is often more complex. Many DAOs still rely on centralized web interfaces, off-chain data storage, or governance platforms controlled by development teams.49 Furthermore, even with decentralized technology, governance power often reconcentrates. Studies show tendencies towards oligarchy in DAOs, where "whales" holding large amounts of governance tokens dominate decision-making.37 Voter apathy remains a persistent problem, with low participation rates undermining the legitimacy of collective choice mechanisms.37 Balancing commercial incentives with the public good goals of the commons proves difficult, leading to free-riding and conflicts of interest.37 High-profile failures, like the original DAO hack which necessitated a controversial blockchain rollback 40, underscore the security and governance risks inherent in these experimental systems.44 Facilitation and learning from failure appear crucial for developing effective enforcement and governance, suggesting that simply implementing the technology is insufficient without guiding principles and adaptive learning processes.53

Ultimately, the experience with DAOs suggests that while technology can provide new tools for coordination and enforcement, it cannot bypass the fundamental social and political challenges of collective action identified by Ostrom. Scaling governance, fostering participation, managing diversity, ensuring accountability, and resolving conflicts remain difficult tasks, often requiring more than just technological fixes. Achieving robust digital self-governance necessitates not only appropriate rules and tools *on* the platform but also addressing the control *over* the platform itself, pushing towards truly decentralized or commoned infrastructure to avoid the pitfalls of the ownership problem.

## **V. Artificial Intelligence: New Frontiers in Ownership and Ethics**

The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI capable of creating novel text, images, code, and other content 54, introduces profound challenges to existing legal and ethical frameworks, especially concerning ownership, authorship, and the use of data. These challenges force a re-examination of the very foundations of intellectual property law and raise urgent questions about fairness, compensation, and control in the age of intelligent machines.

### **Philosophical Debates on AI Authorship and Content Ownership**

A central philosophical and legal question is whether AI systems themselves can be considered "authors" or "inventors" in a way that grants them, or their owners, intellectual property rights over the content they generate.55 Traditional IP law, particularly copyright, was designed to incentivize and reward *human* creativity and generally requires a human author.55

Arguments against granting authorship or ownership rights directly to AI are compelling. AI systems, as currently understood, lack consciousness, intentionality, moral agency, and the capacity for free and creative choices reflecting a personality – qualities often seen as inherent to human authorship.55 Legal systems, particularly in the US, have consistently reinforced the human authorship requirement, denying copyright to works generated solely by animals or machines without sufficient human creative input, as seen in cases like *Naruto v. Slater* (the "monkey selfie" case) and *Thaler v. Perlmutter* (denying copyright to AI-generated art).55 Attributing authorship to AI, critics argue, could devalue human creativity and diminish the recognition and financial incentives for human creators.55

Conversely, arguments are made for recognizing some form of protection or ownership related to AI outputs. One line of reasoning focuses on the significant human input often involved in generating AI content: selecting models, crafting detailed prompts, curating and refining outputs.55 This human involvement, it is argued, constitutes sufficient creative contribution to warrant authorship, vesting rights in the human user or prompter.55 Some court decisions, like a notable 2023 case in Beijing, have recognized user authorship based on extensive prompting and refinement.55 Others emphasize the potential economic and cultural value of AI-generated works and argue that some form of protection is needed to incentivize the development and deployment of AI technologies.63 Some jurisdictions, like the UK, have specific provisions for "computer-generated works," assigning authorship to the person who made the arrangements for the work's creation, although this often comes with limitations like shorter protection terms.55

These legal debates are intertwined with ethical considerations. Beyond authorship, concerns abound regarding the potential for AI to displace human workers in creative industries like writing, art, music, and coding, raising questions about economic fairness and the societal value placed on human labor.55 The 2023 strikes by writers and actors in the US highlighted these anxieties about AI's impact on livelihoods and creative control.55 The very nature of creativity is questioned: can AI output, derived from patterns in data, possess the depth, meaning, and originality associated with human creation, even if technically novel?.55 This entire debate forces a confrontation with the core justifications underpinning IP law itself. Is the primary goal to incentivize creation (a utilitarian rationale), reward labor and express personality (a natural rights rationale), or ensure broad public access to knowledge and culture? AI systems challenge all these justifications simultaneously: their potential impact on human incentives is complex and contested; their status as "laborers" or "personalities" is highly dubious; and their reliance on vast datasets scraped from the existing digital commons complicates arguments based purely on access or rewarding individual creation.10 The difficulty in applying any single traditional justification cleanly to AI pushes the exploration towards alternative or hybrid frameworks.

### **Training Data, Copyright, and Fair Use Controversies**

Equally contentious is the issue of the data used to train generative AI models.65 These models require massive datasets, often comprising billions of text excerpts, images, code snippets, and other works scraped from the public internet.65 A significant portion of this training data is protected by copyright, yet AI developers have frequently used it without seeking permission or providing compensation to the original creators or rights holders.60

This practice raises significant legal challenges.66 The process of copying and analyzing copyrighted works during training potentially infringes the reproduction right.65 Furthermore, if the resulting AI model generates outputs that are substantially similar to or derivative of the training data, it could implicate the right to control derivative works.65 Numerous lawsuits have been filed by authors, artists, and companies like Getty Images against major AI developers, alleging mass copyright infringement through the unauthorized use of their works for training.60 The potential damages in these cases could be substantial, posing a significant financial risk to the AI industry.66

AI developers often counter these claims by invoking copyright exceptions, most notably the doctrine of "fair use" in the US.60 They argue that using copyrighted works for training is a transformative use—creating new tools with different purposes rather than merely reproducing the original works—and that it ultimately promotes the progress of science and art. However, rights holders argue that the commercial nature of many AI models, their potential to supplant markets for the original works, and the sheer scale of the copying weigh against a finding of fair use.60 Other jurisdictions have different exceptions; the EU's Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive includes an exception for text and data mining (TDM) for scientific research and a broader one for general TDM from which rights holders can opt out, while Singapore has a more permissive exception for "computational data analysis".60 The legal landscape remains uncertain and varies significantly across jurisdictions.56

Beyond the legal arguments, profound ethical issues arise from the uncompensated use of vast amounts of human creativity as "training fuel" for commercial AI systems.60 There are also concerns about the exploitation of often low-paid data workers, many located in the Global South, who perform the essential but often invisible labor of labeling, filtering, and annotating the data used to train AI models, a practice sometimes described as "automated colonialism" or "ghost work".64 Calls for greater transparency regarding the composition of training datasets are growing, driven by the need for rights holders to identify infringements and for researchers and the public to scrutinize models for bias and reliability.56 Policy initiatives like the EU AI Act are beginning to incorporate such transparency requirements.66

### **Emerging Frameworks: Beyond Traditional IP (Data Trusts, Liability Rules, Collective Licensing)**

Given the poor fit between traditional IP law and the realities of AI generation and training 55, scholars and policymakers are exploring alternative or supplementary frameworks for governing AI-related data and content. These include:

* **Sui Generis Rights:** Creating entirely new legal rights specifically designed for AI-generated outputs or the data used to train AI. These could differ from copyright or patent in terms of scope, duration, and criteria for protection, potentially offering a more tailored approach.55  
* **Liability Rules:** Shifting the focus from exclusive property rights (the right to exclude) to liability rules (the right to compensation if harm occurs). This approach would concentrate on holding AI developers or deployers accountable for harms caused by AI systems, such as generating infringing content, producing biased or discriminatory outputs, or violating privacy, rather than focusing primarily on who "owns" the AI or its output.58 Implementing such rules effectively requires addressing challenges like assigning responsibility for complex AI systems (the "black box" problem) and defining the threshold for harm.58  
* **Collective Licensing:** Establishing mechanisms, potentially managed by collecting societies similar to those in the music industry, to license the use of copyrighted works for AI training on a large scale.56 These systems would collect fees from AI developers and distribute royalties to the relevant rights holders. Key challenges include the immense scale of training data, the difficulty of tracking the contribution of individual works to specific AI outputs ("subatomic-level copyright"), and ensuring fair distribution.56  
* **Data Trusts and Stewardship:** Creating legal structures, such as data trusts, where data is held and managed by independent fiduciaries on behalf of data subjects, creators, or a defined community.67 These fiduciaries would have a legal duty to act in the beneficiaries' best interests, potentially negotiating terms for data access (e.g., for AI training) and distributing benefits collectively. This model offers a way to manage data based on collective governance and shared benefit rather than individual control or corporate ownership, providing greater bargaining power for data producers.67 It differs from simple contracts or agency relationships by emphasizing collective interest and stronger accountability mechanisms.70 Such models are being explored particularly for sensitive data, like health information.71  
* **Enhanced Public Domain/Commons Approaches:** Arguing that, given the collective nature of the data inputs and the societal benefits of broad access, AI-generated outputs should, by default or after a limited term, enter the public domain.6 This could be combined with alternative compensation mechanisms for human creators whose work contributes to training data, decoupling reward from exclusive control.

The exploration of frameworks like data trusts and collective licensing signals a potential move away from the strictly individualistic basis of traditional IP. These models implicitly recognize the collective or common nature of the data resources fueling AI and attempt to devise governance mechanisms that reflect this shared reality, echoing themes found in commons governance literature.39 They shift the focus towards stewardship, collective bargaining, and shared benefit rather than solely on individual exclusion, suggesting a possible convergence between the challenges of AI and the principles of managing shared resources.

| Alternative Framework | Core Mechanism | Examples/Proponents | Potential Strengths | Potential Weaknesses |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sui Generis Rights** | Creation of new, specific legal rights for AI outputs or training data, distinct from existing IP categories.55 | UK's "computer-generated work" right; Academic proposals. | Tailored protection; Can address specific AI issues directly. | Adds legal complexity; International harmonization difficult; Defining scope and criteria challenging. |
| **Liability Rules** | Focus on compensation for harms caused by AI (e.g., infringement, bias, privacy violation) rather than exclusive ownership rights.58 | Tort law principles; Proposals for specific AI liability regimes. | Addresses negative externalities; Focuses on outcomes; Potentially less restrictive on innovation than property rules. | Difficulty assigning responsibility ("black box"); Defining harm and causation; Potential for under-deterrence or excessive litigation. |
| **Collective Licensing** | Centralized or standardized licensing of training data with royalty distribution to rights holders.56 | Analogy to music collecting societies (ASCAP, BMI); Industry proposals. | Potential for efficient large-scale licensing; Provides compensation mechanism for creators. | Scale and complexity of tracking data use and distributing royalties; Antitrust concerns; Setting fair rates; Representing diverse rights holders. |
| **Data Trusts / Stewardship** | Data managed by independent fiduciaries for the benefit of data subjects/community; Collective negotiation and governance.67 | Academic proposals (e.g., Ada Lovelace Institute); Pilot projects; Health data commons.71 | Empowers data subjects/creators collectively; Enables ethical governance; Potential for fairer benefit sharing; Aligns with commons principles. | Legal and operational complexity of establishing trusts; Ensuring fiduciary accountability; Scalability; Defining beneficiaries and mandates. |
| **Enhanced Public Domain / Commons** | Defaulting AI outputs to public domain; Limiting exclusive rights over training data; Focus on open access.6 | Open source/Creative Commons movements; Arguments against copyright term extension. | Maximizes access and downstream innovation; Avoids artificial scarcity; Simplifies usage rights. | May reduce incentives for AI development or human creation if compensation mechanisms are inadequate; Doesn't directly address uncompensated use of training data. |

## **VI. Philosophical Synthesis: Towards Just and Sustainable Information Commons**

Addressing the complex challenges of property, governance, and access in the digital realm requires drawing upon diverse philosophical traditions. Both analytic and continental philosophy offer critical tools for understanding the dynamics of the digital commons and for envisioning frameworks that promote justice, equity, and sustainability, particularly concerning the often-marginalized Global South. Integrating these perspectives, alongside concepts like information ethics and epistemic justice, is crucial for navigating the path towards a more equitable digital future.

### **Integrating Analytic and Continental Perspectives on Digital Justice**

While the distinction between analytic and continental philosophy can sometimes be overdrawn, they represent different methodological emphases and areas of focus that can be productively combined.72 Analytic philosophy, with its emphasis on conceptual clarity, logical analysis, and rigorous argumentation, provides valuable tools for dissecting concepts like rights, fairness, consent, and justice as they apply to information access, data ownership, and the design of governance mechanisms.72 It can help clarify the structure of arguments about property, evaluate the coherence of different governance models, and define principles for equitable distribution and participation.

Continental philosophy, encompassing traditions like critical theory, phenomenology, post-structuralism, and deconstruction, offers powerful lenses for analyzing the often-hidden dimensions of power, history, and subjectivity embedded within digital systems.73 Thinkers like Foucault provide frameworks for understanding how knowledge and power intertwine within institutions and discourses, applicable to the ways platforms and algorithms shape information flows and categorize users.77 Deleuze's work on "societies of control" offers insights into how networked technologies enable new forms of modulation and influence, moving beyond simple enclosure to more fluid and pervasive forms of governance.73 These perspectives are crucial for critiquing the political economy of digital platforms, the ways technology shapes user experience and agency, and the historical context (including colonialism) that influences contemporary digital inequalities.73

The field of "information ethics" emerges at this intersection, drawing from various philosophical traditions to grapple with the moral dimensions of information creation, organization, dissemination, and use.76 It addresses core issues like privacy, ownership, intellectual freedom, censorship, accountability, security, and access.84 Information ethics highlights the epistemic component of moral action (acting based on available information) and the moral responsibilities associated with producing and disseminating information.76 It also recognizes the potential clash between different cultural value systems, such as the emphasis on individual rights in Western traditions versus collective responsibilities in others 84, a tension particularly relevant in global digital governance debates. Concepts like collective responsibility 83 and the need for participatory governance structures that allow individuals to shape their data environment 88 become central to designing more just digital commons.

### **Epistemic Justice and Access for the Global South**

A critical dimension of digital justice involves addressing the profound inequalities experienced by the Global South. The concept of *epistemic justice*, originating in feminist philosophy and increasingly influential across disciplines, provides a vital framework for understanding these inequalities.75 Epistemic injustice refers to wrongs related specifically to knowledge, credibility, understanding, and participation in meaning-making practices.75 Key forms include *testimonial injustice*, where a speaker's credibility is unfairly downgraded due to identity prejudice (e.g., based on race, gender, or origin), and *hermeneutical injustice*, where individuals or groups lack the shared conceptual resources to make sense of or articulate their own experiences due to marginalization within dominant meaning-making structures.75

The current global digital architecture often perpetuates and exacerbates epistemic injustice against individuals and communities in the Global South.3 This manifests in multiple ways:

* **The Digital Divide:** Persistent inequalities in access to reliable internet connectivity, computing devices, and digital literacy skills limit participation.95  
* **Platform Dominance and Bias:** Global digital platforms, predominantly designed and controlled by entities in the Global North, often embed cultural biases, prioritize dominant languages (primarily English), and deploy algorithms trained on non-representative data, leading to skewed information environments and discriminatory outcomes.3  
* **Data Extraction and Colonialism:** Data generated by users in the Global South is often extracted and utilized by Northern corporations to train AI models and fuel digital economies, with little value or control returning to the communities where the data originated—a phenomenon termed "data colonialism" or "automated colonialism".64  
* **Knowledge Hierarchy and Marginalization:** Existing global knowledge systems, including academic publishing and online encyclopedias, often marginalize knowledge, perspectives, and languages from the Global South.91 Financial barriers like high Article Processing Charges (APCs) for open access publication disproportionately exclude Southern researchers, hindering their ability to contribute to and shape global scholarly discourse.94 Researchers from the South may also face prejudice regarding the perceived credibility of their work.94  
* **Governance Exclusion:** Actors from the Global South are often excluded from or marginalized in global forums where norms, standards, and regulations for the internet and digital technologies are developed, treating them primarily as consumers rather than equal partners in governance.3

While digital commons and open access movements hold the promise of promoting epistemic justice by democratizing access to information and knowledge-creating tools 95, this potential is often unrealized. Without conscious design for equity, these initiatives can inadvertently replicate existing power imbalances.95 For example, OA models based on APCs can shift the barrier from accessing knowledge to publishing it, further disadvantaging under-resourced researchers in the Global South.94 Philanthropic motivations alone are insufficient; social justice principles must underpin these efforts.95

Achieving genuine digital justice, therefore, requires moving beyond simplistic notions of access to tackle these deeper structural and epistemic inequalities. This involves integrating the clarity of analytic justice principles (defining fairness, equity, rights) with the critical insights of continental and postcolonial thought, which expose the operations of power, historical legacies, and the ways knowledge itself is constructed and contested.75 Epistemic justice serves as a crucial bridging concept here, linking the analysis of specific unfair knowledge practices (like biased credibility assessments, analyzable via analytic tools) to their roots in systemic power structures and historical marginalization (the focus of critical traditions).75 Addressing digital injustice demands attention to both dimensions.

Policy proposals and activist efforts increasingly focus on strategies for achieving greater digital equity and epistemic justice for the Global South.3 These include: actively decolonizing knowledge production and dissemination 91; centering the voices, experiences, and leadership of marginalized communities in research and design 93; promoting multilingualism and supporting local content creation 99; developing fair data governance frameworks that prevent extraction and ensure local benefit 89; investing in local digital infrastructure and innovation ecosystems 97; fostering participatory design processes 90; and engaging in cross-cultural ethical dialogue to build more inclusive norms and practices.93 Initiatives like the UN resolution on safe AI systems underscore the need for equitable distribution of benefits globally 97, while platforms like the UNFCCC's Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples platform aim to integrate diverse knowledge systems into policy.90

## **VII. The Digital Commons: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Governance Challenges**

The preceding sections have explored how the unique characteristics of digital information challenge traditional property theories and how alternative frameworks like the commons, drawing on thinkers from Marx to Ostrom, have emerged to conceptualize shared digital resources. This section synthesizes these discussions to analyze the overall viability of the digital commons, evaluating their potential strengths, inherent weaknesses, and the practical challenges involved in their governance and sustainability.

### **Synthesizing the Rethinking of Property in the Digital Age**

The digital age compels a fundamental rethinking of property. The non-rivalrous and easily reproducible nature of digital goods strains Lockean justifications based on labor-mixing and the "enough and as good" proviso, particularly when IP rights create artificial exclusion.8 Marxist value theory confronts the paradox of information having near-zero reproduction cost yet immense economic importance, shifting analytical focus towards relative surplus value, digital labor exploitation, and rent extraction via IP monopolies.23 In this context, the "commons" emerges as a powerful alternative paradigm.1 It moves beyond the binary of private ownership versus state control, offering a framework for understanding resources managed collectively by communities, governed by shared rules and norms.1 This resonates with the collaborative production seen in FOSS and online knowledge projects 22, Hardt and Negri's concept of the multitude producing "the common" 26, and Ostrom's empirically grounded principles for sustainable resource management.39

### **Potential and Pitfalls: Analyzing the Viability of Digital Commons**

Digital commons offer significant potential benefits:

* **Innovation and Access:** By providing open access to information, code, data, and cultural works, they can foster creativity, learning, and downstream innovation.2  
* **Collaboration and Peer Production:** They enable large-scale collaboration among peers, often transcending geographical boundaries, leading to the creation of valuable shared resources like Wikipedia or complex software systems.1  
* **Openness and Transparency:** Many digital commons operate with transparent governance processes and open standards, potentially fostering accountability.2  
* **Alternative Governance:** They represent a "third way" beyond market mechanisms (prices) and state hierarchies (commands), potentially offering more democratic, equitable, and participatory models of resource management.1  
* **Public Digital Infrastructure:** Well-governed digital commons can function as essential public digital infrastructure, providing foundational tools and platforms for society and the economy.4

However, digital commons also face significant weaknesses and pitfalls:

* **Tragedy of the Commons/Anticommons:** While non-rivalrous in consumption, digital commons can suffer from degradation through "pollution" (e.g., misinformation, spam, low-quality contributions).1 AI-generated content, for instance, poses a risk of polluting the information commons with falsehoods or biases.6 Alternatively, excessive fragmentation of control or overly complex rules could lead to underuse (a tragedy of the anticommons).11  
* **Enclosure:** Digital commons are constantly threatened by enclosure from market forces seeking to privatize and commodify shared resources through IP laws, platform capture, or paywalls, and potentially by state actors seeking greater control or surveillance.1  
* **Underprovision and Sustainability:** A major challenge is ensuring the ongoing provision, maintenance, and security of the commons.1 Reliance on volunteer labor or unstable funding can lead to undersupply, burnout, and critical vulnerabilities, as starkly illustrated by the security crises in foundational FOSS projects like Log4j.5 This "Tragedy of the Digital Commons" stems not from resource depletion, but from the underprovision of essential upkeep due to free-riding and coordination failures in a non-excludable environment.5 Solving this requires addressing how to fund and organize the necessary maintenance and governance work.  
* **Governance Failures:** Internal governance can fail due to conflicts, lack of participation, capture by special interests, or the emergence of informal hierarchies or oligarchies, as observed in some FOSS projects and DAOs.36  
* **Environmental Impact:** The digital infrastructure underpinning these commons carries a significant environmental footprint related to energy consumption and electronic waste.1

### **Practical Challenges in Implementation and Governance**

Successfully establishing and sustaining digital commons involves navigating numerous practical challenges:

* **Funding and Sustainability:** Moving beyond volunteerism and project-based grants to secure stable, long-term funding for maintenance, security, and core operations is critical.4 This might involve exploring diverse models like public funding, membership fees, service charges, or public-commons partnerships.  
* **Governance Design:** Developing governance structures that are effective, legitimate, adaptable, and scalable remains a key challenge.1 This involves translating principles like Ostrom's into the digital context, finding ways to foster meaningful participation in large and diverse communities, and balancing efficiency with democratic process. Tools like DAOs offer possibilities but face their own hurdles.37  
* **Legal and Regulatory Frameworks:** Digital commons need supportive legal environments. This includes appropriate licensing regimes (like Creative Commons or FOSS licenses) that prevent enclosure 1, clear legal status for commons-based organizations, and potentially regulations that protect commons from predatory commercial practices or undue state interference.1  
* **Relationship with State and Market:** Defining a productive relationship with state and market actors is crucial.4 Commons may benefit from public funding, data provision, or partnerships, but need to guard against co-option or excessive control.4 Similarly, interaction with market players can bring resources and wider adoption, but also risks exploitation and enclosure if contributions are not reciprocated.5 Navigating this tension between the open, collaborative logic of the commons and the enclosing tendencies of market and state systems is fundamental to their survival and success. Robust internal governance needs to be complemented by supportive external legal and political conditions.1  
* **Social and Cultural Factors:** Building trust, shared norms, and effective communication channels within diverse, often geographically dispersed and pseudonymous online communities is essential for collective action.37 Addressing digital divides and ensuring equitable opportunities for participation across different social groups, including considerations of gender, race, and global location, is vital for the legitimacy and richness of the commons.3

## **VIII. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Property in Information Space**

The exploration of the digital commons reveals a profound transformation in the conceptualization and practice of property, value, and governance, driven by the unique characteristics of information in the digital age. The non-rivalrous, easily reproducible nature of digital goods fundamentally challenges property theories rooted in scarcity and exclusion, such as traditional interpretations of Locke. While Lockean ideas of labor and desert continue to inform justifications for intellectual property, their application is fraught with contradictions, particularly concerning the proviso and the scope of rights, potentially leading to frameworks supporting *less* exclusion than current IP law allows. Marxist analysis highlights the paradoxical role of information in contemporary capitalism: its value, measured in reproduction labor time, tends towards zero, yet it becomes a crucial engine for accumulation through its role in increasing productivity (relative surplus value) and its susceptibility to rent extraction via artificially created monopolies (IP rights). Frameworks like Hardt and Negri's "common" and Marx's "general intellect" capture the rise of collective, networked production of knowledge and culture, while simultaneously warning of capital's relentless drive to enclose and commodify these shared resources.

The governance of these shared digital resources presents its own set of complex challenges. Elinor Ostrom's principles, derived from successful tangible commons, offer valuable insights but face difficulties when scaled to the global, heterogeneous, and often anonymous environments of the internet. Technological solutions like DAOs attempt to instantiate commons governance principles through code, but often stumble on the persistent social and political challenges of collective action, participation, and power dynamics, frequently failing to achieve their decentralized ideals. The "ownership problem" of underlying digital infrastructure remains a critical vulnerability, potentially undermining the autonomy essential for true self-governance unless addressed through decentralized or commoned alternatives. Furthermore, the advent of generative AI introduces entirely new dilemmas regarding authorship, the use of training data scraped from the commons, and the need for novel regulatory frameworks beyond traditional IP, potentially pushing towards more collective stewardship models like data trusts.

Achieving justice and sustainability in this evolving landscape requires a multi-faceted approach. It demands moving beyond simplistic solutions and integrating insights from diverse philosophical traditions. Analytic philosophy's rigor in defining rights and fairness must be combined with continental and critical theory's attention to power structures, historical context, and the ways technology shapes subjectivity. The concept of epistemic justice emerges as particularly crucial, highlighting the need to address not only access to information but also the recognition and credibility of diverse knowledge systems, especially those from the Global South, which continue to face marginalization through data colonialism, biased algorithms, and exclusionary knowledge hierarchies. Open access and digital commons initiatives hold promise but must be consciously designed to counteract, rather than replicate, these deep-seated inequalities.

The future viability of the digital commons hinges on navigating the inherent tensions between their open, collaborative logic and the enclosing pressures of both market and state forces. Success requires robust internal governance mechanisms capable of fostering participation, managing conflict, and ensuring maintenance, coupled with supportive external legal and political frameworks that recognize their value and protect them from undue appropriation or control. The "Tragedy of the Digital Commons" is not one of depletion but of underprovision – a failure of collective action to sustain the shared resource. Addressing this requires innovative approaches to funding, responsibility allocation, and governance design.

Ultimately, the digital commons represent more than just a collection of online resources; they embody a potential shift in how we organize production, share knowledge, and govern collective life. The ongoing co-evolution of digital technology, property norms, and social practices presents both immense opportunities and significant risks. Future research, policy, and practice must focus on developing adaptive, context-aware, and ethically grounded approaches to governance, fostering robust public-commons partnerships where appropriate, refining legal tools for new technological realities like AI, and relentlessly pursuing global digital equity and epistemic justice. Navigating this complex terrain requires continued critical inquiry, experimentation, and a commitment to building information spaces that are not only innovative but also fundamentally just and sustainable for all.
