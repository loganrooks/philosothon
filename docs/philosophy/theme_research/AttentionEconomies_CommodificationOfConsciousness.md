# **Attention Economies: The Commodification of Consciousness**

## **1\. Introduction: The Commodification of Consciousness in the Attention Economy**

### **Defining the Attention Economy and its Stakes**

The contemporary digital landscape is increasingly understood through the lens of an "attention economy," a concept tracing back to Herbert A. Simon's observation in the late 1960s and early 1970s that information overload presents an economic problem.1 Simon famously articulated the core dynamic: “What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention”.3 As digital technologies exponentially increased the supply of accessible information, making content abundant and immediately available, human attention emerged as the critical limiting factor, the scarce commodity in the consumption of information.1 The total available attention is finite, constrained by population size, waking hours, and competing demands.1 This scarcity has led to attention being treated as a valuable resource, fiercely competed for and monetized by platforms, advertisers, and content creators.3 Davenport and Beck later formalized the "economics of attention," treating human attention as a scarce commodity solvable through economic theory and information management principles.1 The challenge shifted from accessing information to allocating limited "human bandwidth" efficiently among the overwhelming sources vying for it.3

The stakes involved in this economic configuration are profound, extending far beyond mere commercial competition. The relentless drive to capture and retain attention implicates the very nature of conscious experience, individual autonomy, psychological well-being, and the structure of social and political life.2 Technologies designed to maximize engagement often employ persuasive and sometimes manipulative techniques, potentially degrading cognitive capacities, fostering addiction, increasing polarization, and eroding the conditions necessary for deep thought, meaningful connection, and democratic deliberation.2 At its core, the attention economy raises critical questions about the "commodification of consciousness" itself – the process by which subjective awareness, focus, and desire become objects of industrial engineering, extraction, and exchange.

The very framing of the "attention economy" around concepts of scarcity, resource allocation, and efficiency, as articulated by Simon, Davenport, and Beck 1, implicitly adopts an analytical or economic perspective. This viewpoint tends to treat attention as a quantifiable, neutral resource to be managed optimally, aligning with philosophical approaches that prioritize logical clarity and objective measurement.17 However, this initial framing sets the stage for profound critiques from thinkers operating within continental and critical traditions. These critiques challenge the perceived neutrality of the economic model, exposing it instead as a system embedded within specific historical power structures, driven by capitalist imperatives, and generating significant subjective and societal harms.12 The tension between the analytical conceptualization of attention as a resource and the critical deconstruction of the attention economy as a system of power and potential alienation forms a central dynamic explored throughout this report. Furthermore, the historical transition from an "information economy" to an "attention economy" marks more than just a quantitative shift. It represents a fundamental change in where value resides and where control is exerted. The technologies initially developed to help humans *manage* information overload, such as algorithms, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence 1, have been repurposed by platforms to *manage and monetize* human attention itself.1 This inversion signifies a crucial transfer of control over cognitive processes from the individual user to the technological system, a mechanism central to the critiques examined herein.

### **Introducing Crawford, Crary, and Stiegler as Key Critical Voices**

Amidst growing concerns about the societal and individual consequences of the attention economy, several critical theorists have offered powerful philosophical analyses. Matthew Crawford, Jonathan Crary, and Bernard Stiegler stand out for their distinct yet complementary perspectives on how contemporary technological and capitalist structures capture, shape, and potentially degrade human attention and subjectivity. Crawford, drawing on phenomenology and cognitive science, emphasizes attention as a form of skilled, embodied agency threatened by abstraction and digital distraction. Crary, employing critical theory and art history, analyzes the relentless temporal logic of "24/7" capitalism and its colonization of waking and sleeping life. Stiegler, rooted in philosophy of technology and phenomenology, warns of a "psychotechnical proletarianization" – a loss of knowledge and care resulting from the industrial capture of attention and desire. While their approaches differ, they share a profound concern for the detrimental impacts of the attention economy on human flourishing, autonomy, and the very fabric of conscious life.

### **Outline of the Report's Argument and Structure**

This report aims to provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the commodification of consciousness within the attention economy. It will delve into the specific arguments of Matthew Crawford, Jonathan Crary, and Bernard Stiegler, examining their core concepts and diagnoses of the contemporary condition. Subsequently, it will explore philosophical arguments concerning cognitive justice and the potential for attention rights, investigating the moral claims individuals might possess regarding their own cognitive resources. The analysis will then synthesize insights from both analytical perspectives (viewing attention as a scarce resource) and continental critiques (analyzing attention capitalism) to evaluate their respective strengths and limitations. Finally, drawing upon this synthesis, the report will outline potential alternative models and principles for organizing the attention economy in ways that better respect human autonomy, well-being, and flourishing. The structure will follow this trajectory, moving from specific critiques to broader ethical considerations and concluding with potential pathways forward.

## **2\. Matthew Crawford: Reclaiming Agency Through Embodied Attention**

### **Attention as Skilled Practice vs. Passive Consumption**

Matthew Crawford, in works like *The World Beyond Your Head*, offers a compelling counter-narrative to passive conceptions of attention prevalent in an era dominated by digital media and consumer culture.25 He posits that attention is not merely the passive reception of external stimuli but an active, *skilled agency* – a capacity developed and refined through meaningful engagement with the material world.11 This skilled attention is cultivated through practices that require focus, discipline, and interaction with tangible realities, such as craftsmanship, repair work, or playing a musical instrument.26 Crawford contrasts this active, formative engagement with the pervasive *passive consumerism* fostered by modern society, where individuals are increasingly positioned as recipients of pre-packaged experiences and stimuli designed to capture rather than cultivate attention.25

Digital environments, Crawford argues, are particularly adept at undermining this skilled agency.25 Designed often for "frictionless, superficial interaction," they detach users from the complexities and resistances of the real world, hindering the development of genuine competence and autonomy.25 These environments are saturated with what Crawford terms "hyperpalatable stimuli" – inputs engineered, much like processed foods, to be irresistibly engaging but ultimately unsatisfying and detrimental to attentional health.28 This constant bombardment leads to a state of chronic distractibility, which Crawford memorably calls the "mental equivalent of obesity".26 Furthermore, the design of digital platforms, driven by commercial interests, often involves sophisticated techniques to manipulate user focus for profit, fragmenting attention and diminishing cognitive autonomy.11 Crawford illustrates this through critiques of modern car design that minimizes driver engagement, toys that simulate interaction without real substance, and the meticulously engineered environments of casino slot machines designed to absorb gamblers' attention completely.25

### **The Role of Embodiment and "Ecologies of Attention"**

Central to Crawford's thesis is the importance of *embodiment*. He rejects Cartesian dualism, arguing that the mind and body are not separate entities; rather, thinking and perception are fundamentally embodied processes.11 Our bodies are not mere vessels for our brains but are the primary tools through which we engage with, understand, and derive meaning from the world.27 We think *through* our bodies, and our physical interactions shape our cognitive capacities.30 This concept extends to the tools we use in skilled practices. Through *cognitive extension*, tools like a craftsman's instrument, an athlete's equipment, or even a blind person's cane can become integrated with the user's sensorimotor system, functioning as extensions of their body and mind, enhancing their perception and agency within the world.28

Building on this embodied perspective, Crawford introduces the idea of "jigs" and "ecologies of attention".25 A jig, borrowed from woodworking, is any tool, setup, or environmental arrangement that constrains choices and simplifies tasks, thereby freeing up cognitive resources and facilitating focused attention.25 An experienced cook arranging ingredients before starting, or a mechanic organizing their tools, creates a supportive "ecology of attention" – an environment structured to minimize distraction and support the skilled practice at hand.25 These ecologies are crucial for developing expertise, as they allow individuals to manage the inherent complexities of real-world tasks. In stark contrast, Crawford suggests that many digital environments actively *dismantle* such supportive ecologies. Their design often prioritizes constant notification, interruption, and context-switching, creating environments optimized for distraction rather than focused engagement.11

The notion of "jigs" underscores a crucial environmental dimension to attention management. For Crawford, effective attention is not solely an internal mental faculty but is deeply intertwined with the structure of one's surroundings.25 Skilled practitioners actively shape their environments to support focus.30 Digital platforms, however, represent structured environments often designed with the opposite goal: to maximize interruption and capture fleeting attention for commercial purposes.11 These platforms can thus be understood as deploying "anti-jigs" – environmental structures deliberately engineered to undermine sustained focus and fragment the user's cognitive landscape. Resisting the detrimental effects of the attention economy, from this perspective, requires not only internal discipline but also the conscious effort to curate and structure one's physical and digital environments to create supportive ecologies of attention.30

### **Critique of Digital Environments and the Path to Flourishing**

Crawford's critique of digital distraction is embedded within a broader philosophical critique of modernity's conception of the self, which he traces back to the Enlightenment.28 He argues that the emphasis on a purely rational, detached, and radically autonomous individual – an "inner mental life" abstracted from material contingencies and external influences (associated with Kantian ideals) – has paradoxically made us *more* susceptible to manipulation.26 This idealized autonomous self, responsible for constructing its identity through abstract choices, becomes lost in a "fog of choices" engineered by commercial interests.11 When "freedom of choice" is elevated as an end in itself, divorced from objective ends or real-world constraints, it becomes easily channeled by those who design the choice architectures, often under the guise of personalization or convenience.11 This leads to the contemporary "crisis of attention," where focus is fragmented, commercially engineered, and silence itself becomes a rare luxury good.25 The self conceived as purely mental and sovereign in its preferences is ill-equipped to recognize or resist the social engineering aimed at shaping those very preferences.11

The path toward reclaiming genuine agency, individuality, and human flourishing, according to Crawford, lies in turning *away* from this abstraction and *towards* the tangible world through engagement in *skilled, hands-on practices*.11 Activities like motorcycle repair, cooking, playing music, or building organs demand sustained, embodied attention.26 They require submitting to the "intractable ways" of materials, tools, and objective standards, rather than relying on subjective preference.11 This process involves confronting resistance, enduring frustration, and developing expertise through disciplined practice.11 In doing so, the self expands not through abstract self-creation, but through mastering skills and developing a competence grounded in reality.11 Flourishing arises from this deep engagement, from finding meaning in "real objects of love" and interacting within a social context where skills are recognized and valued.25 Crawford's call for skilled practice, therefore, is not merely a strategy for managing distraction but a profound philosophical corrective, advocating for a reconstitution of the self grounded in embodied reality, skilled engagement, and objective constraints – a self less vulnerable to the manipulations of the attention economy.26

## **3\. Jonathan Crary: Capitalism's 24/7 Conquest of Time and Mind**

### **The Logic of Perpetual Operation: Blurring Work, Consumption, and Surveillance**

Jonathan Crary, in *24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep*, presents a trenchant critique of contemporary capitalism centered on its relentless drive towards perpetual operation.12 He introduces the concept of "24/7" to describe a condition where the logic of the market expands to colonize every hour of the clock, pushing human life into continuous activity and eroding natural rhythms, pauses, and the very distinction between different spheres of existence.12 This 24/7 world represents "a generalised inscription of human life into duration without breaks, defined by a principle of continuous functioning. It is a time that no longer passes, beyond clock time".36 It fosters what Crary terms a "suspension of living," a state modeled on machine performance rather than organic human needs.36

This "interminable non-time" systematically blurs the boundaries that once structured daily life: the lines between work and leisure, the personal and the professional, entertainment and information become increasingly indistinct as the demands of the non-stop marketplace permeate all domains.12 Ubiquitous digital connectivity, rather than solely enabling communication, becomes a form of "compulsory communication functionality," inherently tied to the inescapable logic of 24/7.33 Crary argues that this perpetual availability and activity directly facilitate intensified, ubiquitous consumerism while simultaneously enabling new, pervasive strategies of control and surveillance.12 The constantly illuminated, always-on network of screens creates an environment reminiscent of Foucault's Panopticon, where individuals are potentially always visible and subject to monitoring, fostering self-discipline aligned with the system's demands.36

Crary's concept of "24/7" functions not simply as a description of contemporary technological affordances but as a potent *political critique* of the temporal logic inherent in late capitalism.13 It reveals how the fundamental restructuring of time – the elimination of pauses, the demand for constant availability, the blurring of distinct life-spheres – serves as a primary mechanism for maximizing control and extracting value.12 This logic extends beyond the traditional confines of the factory or office, infiltrating social interactions, personal life, and ultimately, even the biological necessity of sleep.12 The colonization of time itself becomes a central strategy in the expansion of capitalist relations into previously uncommodified domains of human existence.

### **The Impairment of Perception and the Colonization of Sleep**

Within this 24/7 culture, Crary identifies a systematic *management of individual attentiveness* and a corresponding *impairment of perception*.12 The relentless flow of information and stimuli, coupled with the demand for constant engagement, erodes the capacity for sustained focus, reflection, and modes of thought that require "slow or vacant time," such as daydreaming or introspection.34 These modes of consciousness, incompatible with the priorities of efficiency and speed, are increasingly squeezed out.34 The constant glare of monotonous stimulation, Crary suggests, leads to a homogenization and acceleration of experience that incapacitates vision and diminishes sensory responsiveness.42

The ultimate frontier in this capitalist colonization of time and consciousness is sleep.12 Crary argues that sleep, as a period of necessary withdrawal, inactivity, and non-productivity, represents a fundamental affront to the 24/7 logic of continuous operation and consumption.12 While other human needs like hunger, thirst, and even friendship have been increasingly commodified, sleep remains a significant barrier, an "uncompromising interruption of the theft of time from us by capitalism".34 Consequently, the forces of 24/7 capitalism actively seek to diminish, fragment, or even eliminate sleep. This occurs through various mechanisms: the constant intrusion of notifications and illuminated screens into rest periods 36; architectural and urban designs prioritizing perpetual illumination and activity 42; and, perhaps most chillingly, military and scientific research aimed at creating the "sleepless soldier" – developing pharmacological or technological means to allow humans to function for extended periods without sleep, a development Crary predicts would inevitably migrate to the civilian sphere of workers and consumers.36 The historical use of sleep deprivation as a tool of torture underscores its fundamental importance to human integrity and the violence inherent in its denial.42

### **Sleep as Incompatibility and Site of Potential Refusal**

Despite the onslaught, Crary positions sleep as intrinsically incompatible with the totalizing ambitions of 24/7 capitalism.12 It is a "restorative withdrawal," a necessary period of vulnerability and disengagement from the circuits of production and consumption.12 As a fundamental human need that resists complete instrumentalization for profit, sleep poses a persistent challenge to the system's demand for perpetual availability.34

Because of this inherent incompatibility, Crary suggests that sleep holds potential as a site of both individual and collective refusal.12 It represents not only physiological renewal but also a temporal space outside the relentless drive of the market, a space where alternative modes of being, thinking, and imagining might persist or emerge.13 The shared, vulnerable state of sleep can symbolize the "durability of the social" against the fragmenting forces of individualized consumption and competition.42 In the face of a seemingly inescapable system, the simple, biological act of sleeping, and the dreams it enables, can represent an "intimation... of a radical interruption," potentially foreshadowing more conscious and collective refusals of world-destroying patterns of growth and accumulation.12 This perspective implies that meaningful resistance to the attention economy involves more than just managing screen time; it necessitates challenging the underlying economic and temporal imperatives that drive technological design and deployment. Sleep becomes a powerful symbol for a broader reclamation of non-commodified time and space, a necessary withdrawal from the ceaseless demands of the system.12 However, some critics argue that Crary may romanticize sleep, overlooking the ways it too is subject to commodification through sleep-aid pharmaceuticals, advanced bedding technologies, and the wellness industry.37

### **Implications for Immersive Technologies: Metaverse and AR**

Crary's framework offers a critical lens through which to analyze the potential impact of emerging immersive technologies like the metaverse and augmented reality (AR). Rather than viewing them as neutral platforms for connection or productivity, a Craryan analysis suggests they represent a potential *intensification and acceleration* of the 24/7 logic.35

The metaverse, conceived as a persistent, all-encompassing virtual environment merging work, play, and social life, threatens to dissolve the remaining boundaries between the physical and digital, the online and offline.44 By design, it aims to capture ever-larger shares of users' time and attention, potentially extending the reach of 24/7 surveillance, consumerism, and data extraction into previously private or disconnected aspects of existence.35 Augmented reality, by overlaying digital information and interfaces onto the physical world, similarly threatens to eliminate moments of disconnection, ensuring that the demands of the network are always present, further fragmenting attention and blurring the lines between mediated and unmediated experience.

These technologies could thus exacerbate the trends Crary identifies: the erosion of distinct temporalities, the impairment of reflective capacity, and the colonization of consciousness. They risk creating environments where withdrawal is increasingly difficult, if not impossible, pushing towards a more complete realization of the non-stop, non-social model of machine performance that Crary critiques.35 The "extraction of cognitive work, attention, \[and\] personal data" 35, already central to the current attention economy, could reach unprecedented levels within these deeply integrated, data-rich immersive spaces, making resistance and the preservation of non-commodified time even more challenging. From this perspective, the development of the metaverse and AR is not a neutral technological progression but a potential deepening of capitalism's 24/7 conquest of human time and mind.

## **4\. Bernard Stiegler: The Proletarianization of Spirit via Psychopower**

### **Psychotechnologies and the Industrial Capture of Attention**

Bernard Stiegler, a philosopher deeply engaged with the role of technics in human existence, offers a distinct framework for analyzing the attention economy through the concepts of *psychopower* and *proletarianization*. Stiegler argues that contemporary power operates less through Foucault's concept of biopower (managing populations biologically) and more through *psychopower* – the control of consciousness, behavior, and desire achieved via *psychotechnologies*.20 These psychotechnologies encompass media such as radio and television, but find their most potent expression in contemporary digital platforms and marketing industries.45

Psychopower functions by systematically capturing the attention of individuals and channeling their libidinal energy – the fundamental drive of desire – towards consumer objects and market-driven behaviors.3 This industrial-scale capture and redirection of desire is orchestrated by what Stiegler terms the "programming industries" (a combination of the Frankfurt School's cultural industries and Enzensberger's consciousness industry), which utilize sophisticated techniques to modulate affect and attention for economic gain.22 This constitutes nothing less than a "war for attention," where consciousness itself is the battlefield.10

Stiegler grounds his analysis of attention in a phenomenological understanding derived from Edmund Husserl, focusing on the temporal structure of consciousness.3 Consciousness unfolds through a continuous interplay of *retention* (the holding onto of the immediate past in primary retention, and the recall of the accumulated past in secondary retention or memory) and *protention* (the anticipation or projection into the future). Attention, for Stiegler, is precisely this dynamic coupling of retentions and protentions.10 Crucially, he introduces the concept of *tertiary retention* – externalized, technical supports for memory (from cave paintings and writing to digital databases and algorithms).10 These mnemotechnics or psychotechnics are not merely tools but are constitutive of human consciousness and subjectivity; they shape our secondary retentions and thus our protentions and attention.10 Psychopower operates by industrially producing and controlling these tertiary retentions (e.g., the content and interfaces of digital media), thereby manipulating the temporal flow of consciousness, capturing attention, and often "short-circuiting" the development of long-term desire and critical thought.3 This provides a specific phenomenological *mechanism* for how attention capture functions: by intervening in and controlling the temporal constitution of subjectivity itself, psychopower reshapes experience, desire, and identity at a fundamental level, explaining its profound impact.

### **Loss of *Savoir* (Faire, Vivre, Théoriser) and Symbolic Misery**

The primary consequence of the operation of psychopower through psychotechnologies is what Stiegler terms *proletarianization*.45 Extending Marx's concept beyond the industrial worker's loss of manual skill, Stiegler applies it to a generalized loss of knowledge, or *savoir*, across multiple domains of human life.21 This includes:

1. ***Savoir-faire***: Practical know-how, the embodied skills involved in making and doing.  
2. ***Savoir-vivre***: Existential know-how, the art of living, including social skills, ethical comportment, and the capacity for care and relationship.  
3. ***Savoir-théoriser***: Theoretical or conceptual know-how, the ability to think critically, abstractly, and form independent judgments. 49

Proletarianization occurs when these forms of knowledge, previously embodied in individuals and transmitted through culture and education, become formalized, externalized, and controlled by technical systems, primarily those serving the market.21 Psychopower accelerates this process by capturing attention and homogenizing perception through the industrial production and circulation of images, sounds, and information.21 Individuals are reduced to passive consumers of pre-packaged experiences and meanings, losing their own *savoir* and the capacity to critically engage with the world.21 This applies not only to consumers ("proletarianization of sensibility" 21) but also to intellectual workers whose cognitive functions are constrained and deskilled by information systems they do not control ("proletarianization of noesis" or thinking 46). This extension of Marx's concept suggests that the core exploitation in the attention economy involves the degradation of fundamental human capacities for meaning-making, critical thought, and care – a deeper alienation impacting consciousness and existence itself.21

This loss of *savoir* leads to what Stiegler calls *symbolic misery*: a state characterized by the loss of individual and collective participation in the production of symbols, meanings, ideals, and values.3 When the symbolic environment is dominated by the market and its psychotechnologies, individuals are deprived of the ability to contribute to or shape the shared meanings that constitute culture and society. Existence risks shrinking to mere subsistence, devoid of the "consistence" provided by shared ideals and symbols.3 This condition of symbolic misery connects the individual psychological effects of attention capture to a broader socio-political crisis. The inability to participate in generating shared meaning, stemming from a proletarianized consciousness, undermines the process of collective individuation (the formation of shared identities and values) and cripples the capacity for critical political thought and action necessary for societal transformation.3

### **Erosion of Care, Deep Attention, and Intergenerational Bonds**

Stiegler argues forcefully that the destruction of attention, driven by the mechanisms of psychopower and resulting in proletarianization, has devastating consequences for fundamental human capacities, including care, deep attention, and intergenerational relationships.3

* **Care:** The capacity for *care* – for oneself, for others, and for the world – is intrinsically linked to attention.3 Care requires sustained focus, empathy, and the ability to attend to the needs and specificities of the object of care. Stiegler sees care as a crucial aspect of *savoir-vivre*, a learned social competence transmitted primarily through education and intergenerational bonds.3 The constant distraction and fragmentation of attention fostered by psychotechnologies erode this capacity, making genuine care difficult.49 The example of parents distracted by smartphones while interacting with infants starkly illustrates how technology can interfere with the attentional presence necessary for nurturing relationships and transmitting care.50  
* **Deep Attention:** Psychotechnologies are designed to capture attention through novelty, emotional triggers, and rapid stimuli, fostering *hyper-attention* – a state of quickly shifting focus between multiple inputs – at the expense of *deep attention*, the ability to concentrate on a single object or task for extended periods.49 This shift hinders profound learning, critical reflection, complex problem-solving, and the development of nuanced understanding.49 Stiegler sees the reconstruction of deep attention as a crucial task, particularly for educational institutions like universities, in resisting the "toxic effects" of the marketing-driven mnemotechnical system.50 Concerns about rising ADHD diagnoses and the neurological impacts of digital reading ("digital reading brain") further underscore the threat to deep attention.49  
* **Intergenerational Bonds:** Attention is fundamental to education and the transmission of knowledge, values, and cultural memory across generations.10 This transmission relies on the circuits of retention and protention, where the experiences and memories (secondary retentions) of one generation, often mediated by cultural artifacts and practices (tertiary retentions), shape the attention and future orientations (protentions) of the next.3 When industrial psychotechnologies capture and fragment attention, these vital intergenerational circuits are disrupted or "short-circuited".3 This undermines the formation of stable individual and collective identities (transindividuation 48) and hinders the passing down of essential *savoir-vivre*, contributing to a sense of cultural disorientation and the weakening of social bonds.10

### **Comparative Analysis**

The distinct yet overlapping critiques of Crawford, Crary, and Stiegler offer a multi-faceted understanding of the attention economy's impact. The following table summarizes their key perspectives:

| Feature | Matthew Crawford | Jonathan Crary | Bernard Stiegler |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Core Problem** | Crisis of Attention; Loss of Agency | 24/7 Capitalism; Colonization of Time | Psychopower; Proletarianization of Spirit |
| **Mechanism** | Digital Distraction; Abstract Self | Perpetual Operation; Sleep Erosion | Psychotechnologies; Attention Capture |
| **Key Concept** | Skilled Agency; Embodied Cognition | 24/7 Non-Time; Incompatibility | Psychopower; Loss of *Savoir* |
| **Impact On** | Focus; Autonomy; Flourishing | Rest; Perception; Community | Knowledge; Desire; Care; Transmission |
| **Solution/Hope** | Skilled Practices; Real Engagement | Refusal; Reclaiming Time (Sleep) | Therapeutics; Rebuilding Attention/Care |
| **Discipline** | Philosophy/Cognitive Science | Critical Theory/Art History | Philosophy of Technology/Phenomenology |

This comparison highlights how Crawford focuses on the degradation of individual agency through detachment from embodied skill, Crary emphasizes the temporal logic of capitalism colonizing all of life, and Stiegler diagnoses a systemic loss of knowledge and care driven by the technological manipulation of consciousness. Together, they paint a comprehensive picture of the challenges posed by the commodification of consciousness.

## **5\. Philosophical Perspectives: Cognitive Justice and the Right to Attention**

The critiques offered by Crawford, Crary, and Stiegler raise profound ethical questions about the status of attention and cognitive processes in the contemporary world. Examining philosophical traditions concerning rights, autonomy, and justice provides essential frameworks for evaluating the moral claims individuals might possess regarding their own minds in the face of the attention economy.

### **Moral Claims to Cognitive Resources and Mental Integrity**

The idea that individuals have a moral claim to control their own mental faculties has deep roots in philosophy. Immanuel Kant's emphasis on human dignity and autonomy, expressed in the principle that humanity must always be treated as an end and never merely as a means, provides a powerful foundation.53 Treating someone as an end entails respecting their capacity for free choice.53 This principle underpins fundamental rights related to self-determination. Earlier traditions, including Stoicism and natural law theories, also posited specific human faculties for moral understanding and insight, suggesting an inherent value placed on cognitive capacities.54

Building on these foundations, contemporary discussions are exploring concepts like *cognitive justice* and *mental integrity*. Cognitive justice refers broadly to fairness concerning cognitive processes, the validation of diverse knowledge systems, and the distribution of epistemic authority.55 In the context of the attention economy, it draws attention to how attentional harms might be unequally distributed, potentially exacerbating existing social inequalities.14 It also suggests that attention itself can possess intrinsic epistemic value, crucial for just engagement with the world, independent of the specific knowledge it might yield.56

*Mental integrity* refers more specifically to the right to the soundness, proper functioning, and self-governance of one's mental states and capacities, free from unwarranted external interference or manipulation.7 Arguments for mental integrity often draw parallels with the widely accepted right to bodily integrity.58 If interference with one's body against one's will is wrong, analogous arguments suggest that non-consensual interference with one's mental processes (thoughts, feelings, attention) is also wrong.58 The attention economy, with its reliance on persuasive design, distraction, and the exploitation of cognitive biases to shape behavior, arguably poses a significant threat to mental integrity.58 It involves external forces attempting to direct mental resources in ways individuals might not autonomously choose, potentially impairing cognitive function and emotional well-being.7

### **Cognitive Liberty and Autonomy in the Face of Manipulation**

Closely related to mental integrity is the concept of *cognitive liberty*. Coined by neuroethicists and legal theorists, cognitive liberty denotes the fundamental right to self-determination over one's own brain and mental experiences.61 This encompasses both the freedom *to* alter one's own mental states (e.g., through learning or chosen substances) and, crucially, the freedom *from* having one's mental processes monitored, accessed, or manipulated by others without consent.61 The rise of neurotechnologies capable of decoding brain activity makes cognitive liberty an urgent concern 61, but the concept extends readily to the broader digital environment.

The practices of the attention economy, such as algorithmic filtering, digital nudging, and micro-targeted advertising, directly challenge cognitive liberty and individual autonomy.63 By exploiting psychological vulnerabilities and shaping information environments, these techniques aim to guide choices and behaviors, often bypassing conscious deliberation.66 This resonates with Crawford's concerns about manipulation disguised as choice 27 and Stiegler's analysis of psychopower channeling desire.20 Algorithmic curation can limit exposure to diverse perspectives, hindering the formation of independent, critical views 66, while persuasive design can foster compulsive behavior and undermine intentional action.6

A necessary corollary to cognitive liberty is *mental privacy* – the right to prevent unauthorized access to or collection of one's neural data and, more broadly, one's thoughts, feelings, and intentions.61 As technologies advance, the ability to infer mental states from behavioral data or even direct neural measurement increases, making the protection of this internal space paramount.61 Protecting mental privacy is essential for safeguarding freedom of thought, self-determination, and the possibility of authentic selfhood in an increasingly transparent and manipulative digital age.61 The call for cognitive liberty and associated rights like mental privacy represents a crucial evolution of traditional rights frameworks. Concepts like freedom of thought and privacy, historically focused on outward expression or protection from physical intrusion and data collection, must be updated to address the novel threats posed by technologies capable of intervening directly in *internal cognitive processes*.58 This signifies a necessary expansion of rights discourse to safeguard human autonomy at the level of thought and attention itself.

### **Developing an Ethics of Attention: Normative Frameworks**

Given the centrality of attention to nearly every aspect of mental life – shaping perception, experience, belief, memory, desire, character, values, and action – there is a compelling argument for developing a dedicated *ethics of attention*.56 Just as epistemology examines norms for belief and ethics examines norms for action, an ethics of attention would investigate the normative pressures governing how we deploy our attentional capacities.68 Key questions arise: What objects or concerns *deserve* our attention? What constitutes a virtuous or vicious pattern of attention? Are there moral, epistemic, prudential, or aesthetic norms governing attention?.68

Several potential grounds exist for asserting a *right to attention*, understood as a right to direct one's focus according to one's own values and goals, and a right to be free from unwarranted distraction and manipulation.7 Such a right could be justified by appealing to:

* **Autonomy:** As attention is fundamental to agency and choice, protecting the ability to control one's attention is essential for self-determination.14  
* **Well-being:** The ability to focus on meaningful activities and avoid constant, unwanted distraction is crucial for psychological health and flourishing.14 Persistent attentional harms undermine well-being.14  
* **Dignity:** Respecting human dignity may entail respecting the integrity of individuals' conscious experience, which is structured by attention.53  
* **Capacity Development:** Some argue for a right not just to direct existing attention, but to cultivate and strengthen the capacity for attentional control, which is often weakened by the attention economy.59

Furthermore, philosopher Iris Murdoch provides a compelling perspective on the inherent *moral dimension* of attention itself.72 For Murdoch, the moral life is not primarily about grand decisions or adherence to abstract principles, but about the quality of one's ongoing attention to the reality of others. Cultivating a "just and loving gaze" towards the world, particularly towards other people, involves overcoming egoism and striving to see others clearly, in their particularity. This act of attention is itself a moral achievement.72

Establishing an ethics of attention, however, requires navigating a fundamental tension. On one hand, attention is presented as a faculty under (at least partial) voluntary control, making it subject to normative evaluation and individual responsibility.68 We can be praised or blamed for what we attend to. On the other hand, attention is profoundly vulnerable to external capture and manipulation by forces specifically designed to bypass or override volitional control, as seen in the attention economy.58 This duality highlights the complex interplay between individual agency and powerful systemic forces. An adequate ethics of attention must therefore grapple with both personal virtue and discipline *and* the need for structural conditions (including potential regulation) that protect attentional capacities from systemic exploitation. This tension directly informs debates about the balance between individual responsibility and the ethical obligations of technology designers and platforms. The recognition of "attentional harms" 14 further solidifies the ethical stakes, extending moral concern beyond traditional categories of harm to include the degradation of cognitive functions and the impairment of the capacity for a meaningful life. This frames attention not merely as a tool, but as a core component of human flourishing itself, demanding ethical scrutiny of any system that treats it purely as a commodity.

## **6\. Synthesizing Critiques and Envisioning Alternatives**

Developing pathways beyond the current dynamics of the attention economy requires integrating the diverse critical perspectives offered by thinkers like Crawford, Crary, and Stiegler, alongside the ethical frameworks concerning cognitive rights and justice. A synthesis of analytical and continental approaches can provide a more comprehensive understanding and point towards principles for alternative models centered on human autonomy and flourishing.

### **Bridging Divides: Analytic Resource Models and Continental Critiques**

Philosophical inquiry into attention often reflects the broader methodological divergence between analytic and continental traditions.17 The *analytic* perspective frequently approaches attention as a scarce cognitive resource, emphasizing limits, efficiency, rationality, and individual capacities.17 This view often underpins economic models of the attention economy (treating attention as a commodity to be allocated 3) and psychological studies of cognitive load and bias.4 Its strengths lie in its potential for clarity, logical rigor, and empirical investigation of attentional mechanisms and their measurable effects.18

In contrast, the *continental/critical* perspectives, exemplified by Crawford, Crary, and Stiegler, tend to analyze attention within broader contexts of power, history, technology, and embodiment.17 They focus on themes of alienation, commodification, the shaping of subjective experience, and systemic critique, emphasizing the non-neutrality of the attention economy as a construct embedded within capitalist social relations.12 Their strength lies in revealing the underlying ideologies, historical trajectories, and existential stakes involved.18

While historically marked by disinterest or hostility 19, these approaches need not be mutually exclusive. A comprehensive understanding of the attention economy benefits from *both* perspectives.19 Analytic tools can help quantify attentional limits, model the effects of specific design features, and identify cognitive vulnerabilities exploited by platforms.4 Continental critiques, meanwhile, are essential for uncovering the power dynamics, economic imperatives, and historical forces that drive the exploitation of those vulnerabilities, revealing the deeper societal and existential implications.18 For instance, the cognitive biases studied by behavioral economics (an analytic-aligned field) 4 can be understood through Stiegler's critical lens as the very mechanisms leveraged by psychopower to capture attention and short-circuit desire.20 Synthesizing these approaches suggests that tackling the problems of the attention economy requires addressing both the *individual cognitive vulnerabilities* susceptible to manipulation and the *systemic political-economic structures* that incentivize and perpetuate this manipulation. Focusing solely on individual cognitive strategies or design tweaks ignores the powerful systemic pressures, while focusing only on grand systemic critique may lack concrete levers for practical change.

### **Principles for a Humane Attention Economy: Autonomy, Well-being, Flourishing**

Drawing from the critiques and ethical considerations discussed, several core principles emerge as essential guides for designing alternative models of the attention economy that prioritize human values over mere engagement metrics:

1. **Respect for User Autonomy:** Designs should empower users with genuine control and informed choice regarding how their attention is engaged.15 This involves avoiding manipulative or deceptive techniques ("dark patterns" 79) and ensuring transparency about data use and algorithmic processes.15 The goal should be to support users in achieving their own intentions, rather than overriding them for platform objectives.6 This principle directly connects to the concepts of cognitive liberty and the right to attention.  
2. **Prioritization of User Well-Being:** Ethical design must move beyond optimizing for time-on-site or clicks and instead consider the holistic impact on users' mental and emotional health.14 This means actively avoiding designs that foster addiction, anxiety, social comparison, or diminished self-worth, and instead promoting experiences that support focus, reflection, and genuine connection.2 This addresses the "attentional harms" identified earlier.14  
3. **Transparency and Clarity:** Users deserve a clear understanding of how platforms function, how their attention is being solicited, and how their data is used.15 This requires straightforward communication, easily accessible controls, and avoidance of obfuscation.79 Transparency builds trust and enables meaningful consent.63  
4. **Value Alignment and Intentionality:** Technology should ideally align with and support users' deeper values and goals, rather than exploiting base impulses or manufacturing desires.15 Design can encourage mindful, intentional engagement rather than passive, reactive consumption.15 This might involve moving towards an "intention economy" that seeks to understand and support users' underlying goals over time, rather than just capturing fleeting attention.6  
5. **Fostering Flourishing:** The ultimate aim should extend beyond minimizing harm to actively contributing to human flourishing.14 This involves designing for capacities central to a rich human life, such as deep attention (Stiegler), skilled engagement (Crawford), care (Stiegler), meaningful social connection, and personal growth.2

Implementing these principles necessitates a fundamental shift in the underlying *telos* or goal of technology design and the economic models supporting it. The current attention economy largely optimizes for maximizing engagement and extracting profit, often treating human attention as a means to that end.5 The proposed alternatives implicitly or explicitly replace this goal with the promotion of human flourishing, demanding a redefinition of "value" and "success" in the digital sphere.2 This represents not just a technical adjustment but a profound ethical reorientation.

### **Exploring Alternative Frameworks: Ethical Design, Attention Commons, Regenerative Models**

Moving towards an attention economy guided by principles of autonomy and flourishing requires exploring concrete alternative frameworks at multiple levels:

* **Ethical and Humane Design Practices:** This involves translating the principles above into specific design patterns and choices. Resources like the Center for Humane Technology and frameworks like "Humane by Design" offer concrete examples.84 Key practices include: avoiding "dark patterns" that deceive or coerce users 79; implementing principles of "Calm Technology" that minimize intrusion and respect context 84; designing interfaces that encourage mindfulness, reflection, and deliberate action rather than compulsive use 15; prioritizing accessibility and inclusive design 84; and fostering transparency in how algorithms work and data is used.79 Ethical design education is also crucial.87  
* **Alternative Funding and Platform Models:** The dominant advertising-based business model creates powerful incentives to maximize attention capture, often at the expense of user well-being.5 Exploring alternatives is critical. Possibilities include: subscription models (though potential equity issues arise); public funding for essential digital infrastructure; platform cooperatives owned by users or creators; data commons or trusts that give individuals more control over their data and its use 88; micropayment systems; or models that reward the creation of genuine value rather than simply harvesting attention.1 Some propose direct payment from advertisers to consumers for their attention, potentially internalizing externalities but raising other concerns.9  
* **Attention Commons Governance:** Reframing attention not just as an individual resource but as a vital *commons* – a shared resource essential for personal cognition, social interaction, and democratic life – offers a powerful alternative perspective.26 This view suggests that current platforms are effectively enclosing and expropriating this commons for private profit.90 Protecting this commons requires developing governance structures beyond individual control or simple market mechanisms. Drawing inspiration from Elinor Ostrom's work on governing common-pool resources, models like polycentric governance, co-management involving users and platforms, or community-based stewardship could be explored.80 Principles for commons-based data governance, emphasizing sharing with restrictions, transparency, respect for creators/subjects, protection of the commons, data quality, and trusted institutions, provide a blueprint.80 This framing shifts the focus from purely individual rights to collective resource management and the preservation of attention as crucial public infrastructure.  
* **Regenerative Economic Models:** Some envision a more fundamental shift towards a "conscious attention economy" 2 or "regenerative" models.1 These approaches emphasize respect, reciprocity, and mutual benefit among all stakeholders (users, platforms, society, environment).1 The goal is to move away from extractive business models that deplete attentional resources and generate negative externalities, towards generative models where value continuously increases for all participants, aligning with broader goals like the UN Sustainable Development Goals.2 This requires embedding ethical values and a commitment to well-being directly into algorithms, business models, and platform designs.2  
* **Regulation:** Given the limitations of self-regulation 16 and the powerful incentives of the current market, regulatory interventions may be necessary. Potential approaches include: banning specific manipulative design features (e.g., infinite scroll, autoplay for children 67); stricter rules on data collection and use, particularly for personalization and targeting; requirements for algorithmic transparency and accountability; establishing duties of care for platforms, especially concerning minors (e.g., proposals like KOSA 16); or even structural regulations addressing market concentration.16 Taxing attention-intensive activities has also been proposed.16 Regulation faces challenges in keeping pace with technology and balancing competing interests (e.g., free speech, innovation).16

## **7\. Conclusion: Resisting Commodification and Cultivating Conscious Attention**

The analyses of Matthew Crawford, Jonathan Crary, and Bernard Stiegler converge in highlighting the profound ways in which contemporary economic and technological systems are reshaping human consciousness by treating attention as a primary commodity. Crawford illuminates the erosion of skilled, embodied agency through the promotion of abstract, passive consumption and digital distraction. Crary exposes the relentless temporal logic of 24/7 capitalism as it colonizes waking life and encroaches upon the essential refuge of sleep. Stiegler warns of a systemic proletarianization of spirit, where the industrial capture of attention via psychotechnologies leads to a devastating loss of knowledge, desire, and the capacity for care. Together, their critiques reveal the multi-layered nature of the "commodification of consciousness," implicating not just our focus, but our agency, our experience of time, our knowledge systems, and our ability to form meaningful connections and values.

This critical landscape underscores the ethical imperative to develop robust frameworks for cognitive justice and attentional rights. In an age where technology can increasingly monitor, predict, and manipulate mental states, traditional notions of privacy and freedom of thought must evolve. Recognizing cognitive liberty, mental integrity, and a potential right to attention becomes crucial for safeguarding individual autonomy and well-being against sophisticated forms of digital influence and exploitation. These frameworks must address not only individual vulnerabilities but also the systemic inequalities that may arise when the capacity to protect one's attention becomes a privilege.

The pathways towards resisting this commodification and cultivating a more conscious relationship with attention are necessarily multifaceted, reflecting the complexity of the problem itself. No single solution suffices. Intervention is required at multiple levels simultaneously:

* **Individual Practice:** Cultivating personal disciplines, such as Crawford's skilled engagement with the material world or mindfulness practices aimed at strengthening attentional control, remains essential for navigating distracting environments.81  
* **Ethical Design:** Shifting design philosophy away from maximizing engagement towards prioritizing user well-being, autonomy, and flourishing is critical. Implementing humane and calm technology principles can mitigate harms and create more supportive digital ecologies.84  
* **Structural Change:** Addressing the underlying economic drivers requires exploring alternative funding models beyond advertising, potentially embracing subscription, public, or commons-based approaches that decouple profit from raw attention capture.8 Reimagining attention as a commons necessitates new forms of governance to protect it as a shared resource.80  
* **Regulation:** Targeted legal interventions may be needed to curb the most harmful practices, protect vulnerable populations, mandate transparency, and establish clear duties of care for platforms.16

Ultimately, the challenge posed by the attention economy transcends mere technological management or economic efficiency. It calls for a conscious, critical engagement with the forces shaping our inner lives. The goal emerging from this analysis is not simply to *manage* attention more effectively within the existing paradigm, but to fundamentally *reclaim and cultivate* attention as integral to human dignity, agency, care, and collective well-being. This involves challenging the commodification imperative itself and striving towards alternative models – whether framed as ethical design, an attention commons, or a conscious, regenerative economy 1 – that recognize the intrinsic value of attention and prioritize the flourishing of the conscious lives it enables.
