# Philosothon Workshop Descriptions

## Philosophy of Technology Workshops

### Language Models as Philosophical Objects
*Explore large language models beyond their practical applications, focusing on their philosophical implications. How do LLMs challenge our understanding of knowledge, creativity, and meaning? What new philosophical questions emerge from these technologies?*

**Relevant themes:**
- Minds and Machines (Primary)
- Technological Singularity (Primary)
- Algorithmic Aesthetics (Strong)
- Epistemic Dimensions of AI (Strong)

### Generative AI Art: Creativity, Authorship, and Aesthetics
*Explore generative AI art tools hands-on while engaging with philosophical questions about creativity, authorship, and aesthetic value. What counts as art in an age when machines can generate images? Does AI-generated art challenge our understanding of artistic expression?*

**Relevant themes:**
- Algorithmic Aesthetics (Primary)
- Minds and Machines (Strong)
- Digital Ethics (Moderate)
- Extended Perception (Moderate)

### Reinforcement Learning: The Technical Foundations of AGI
*This workshop demystifies reinforcement learning technologies that underpin modern AI systems, providing philosophy students with technical grounding while exploring questions of creativity, agency, and intention in artificial systems.*

**Relevant themes:**
- Minds and Machines (Primary)
- Technological Singularity (Primary)
- Algorithmic Aesthetics (Strong)
- Algorithmic Governance (Moderate)

### Technology as Tool vs Master: Beyond Instrumentalism
*Drawing on Heidegger, Feenberg, and other thinkers, this workshop examines competing frameworks for understanding our relationship with technology. Are we using technology, or is it using us? We'll explore instrumental, deterministic, and critical theories of technology.*

**Relevant themes:**
- Extended Perception (Primary)
- Technological Singularity (Primary)
- Digital Ethics (Strong)
- Attention Economies (Strong)

### Digital Commons and Information Capitalism
*This workshop explores the political economy of information and knowledge in digital spaces. Drawing on theories from Ostrom to Marx, we'll examine how property, enclosure, and commons function in information economies.*

**Relevant themes:**
- Digital Commons (Primary)
- Digital Ethics (Strong)
- Algorithmic Governance (Strong)
- Attention Economies (Moderate)

### The Attention Economy: Technical Mechanisms and Philosophical Implications

**Relevant themes:**
- Attention Economies (Primary)
- Digital Ethics (Strong)
- Extended Perception (Strong)
- Digital Commons (Moderate)

### Thinking Through Technical Systems: A Philosophical Approach
*This workshop explores methodologies for critically examining the logic and values embedded in technical systems. Participants will learn frameworks for analyzing technologies as philosophical objects with their own ontologies and epistemologies.*

**Relevant themes:**
- Algorithmic Governance (Primary)
- Digital Ethics (Strong)
- Digital Commons (Strong)
- Technological Singularity (Moderate)

### Design Philosophy: From Metaphysics to Material Reality
*How do philosophical commitments manifest in technological design? This workshop explores the relationship between metaphysical positions and the creation of technologies, examining how designers' philosophical assumptions shape our technical environment.*

**Relevant themes:**
- Extended Perception (Primary)
- Algorithmic Aesthetics (Strong)
- Digital Ethics (Moderate)
- Minds and Machines (Moderate)
