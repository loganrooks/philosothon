# **Philosothon: Where Philosophy Meets Hackathon Culture**

## **An Experimental Event at the University of Toronto**

The Philosophy of Technology Group at the University of Toronto is hosting a groundbreaking event that brings the collaborative energy of hackathons to the world of philosophical inquiry. The **Philosothon** will take place on **April 26-27, 2025**, bringing together students for an intensive day of collaborative thinking on pressing questions at the intersection of philosophy and technology.

## **What is a Philosothon?**

While traditional hackathons gather programmers to build software in a limited timeframe, the Philosothon adapts this model for philosophical exploration. Small teams of students will work together to develop robust philosophical perspectives on contemporary technological issues—combining research, critical thinking, and argumentative rigor in a collaborative environment.

## **Why This Matters**

Philosophy has traditionally been practiced as a solitary pursuit—reading, writing, and thinking in isolation. The Philosothon challenges this norm by creating a space where philosophical ideas can emerge through dialogue and collaboration, mirroring how many other disciplines approach complex problems.

"Philosophy students rarely get structured opportunities for extended collaborative thinking," notes the event organizer. "We're testing whether the hackathon format can bring new energy to philosophical inquiry while building intellectual community."

## **The Format**

Teams will tackle a philosophical theme related to technology—possibilities include consciousness and artificial intelligence, digital ethics, or algorithmic governance. After a day of collaborative work, each team will present their philosophical arguments to the group.

The event includes:

* A philosophy of technology workshop with lunch
* A hands-on workshop with Pascal Quest, exploring philosophical questions through technological interaction (with one representative per team)
* Team-based philosophical investigation
* Presentations of developed perspectives

## **Event Details**

**Dates:** April 26-27, 2025  
**Location:** Bahen Atrium, University of Toronto  
**Participants:** 15-30 University of Toronto philosophy students  
**Format:** A collaborative philosophical exploration culminating in team presentations

## **The Bigger Picture**

This trial event represents an educational experiment in how philosophical thinking might be practiced differently. While currently limited to philosophy students, the organizers envision potential future iterations that could bridge philosophy with other disciplines, encouraging technologists, scientists, and artists to incorporate philosophical reflection into their work.

The Philosothon joins a growing movement to reimagine how the humanities are taught and practiced in the 21st century, responding to calls for more collaborative, interdisciplinary, and engaged approaches to traditional fields.
