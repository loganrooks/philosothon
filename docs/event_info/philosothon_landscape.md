# **Exploring the Landscape of Philosothons and Philosophy Hackathons**

Philosothons and Philosophy Hackathons represent innovative and increasingly popular methods for engaging students in philosophical inquiry. These events aim to cultivate critical thinking, collaborative skills, and effective communication, extending the traditional study of philosophy beyond the classroom. This report provides a comprehensive overview of successful Philosothons and Philosophy Hackathons, examines their structures and potential challenges, and offers organizational insights for those planning to implement such initiatives. By drawing upon existing examples and research, this report serves as a detailed guide for educators and organizers seeking to foster philosophical engagement among students through these dynamic formats.

## **Philosothons: A Deep Dive**

### **Successful Examples and Historical Context**

The concept of the Philosothon has gained significant traction within the philosophy education community, particularly alongside the Philosophy for Children (P4C) movement 1. The first Australasian Philosothon took place at Cranbrook School in Sydney in 2011, marking a pivotal moment in the formalization of this approach in the region 1. Following this, the United Kingdom held its first Philosothon in 2012 at King's College, Taunton, indicating the growing international interest in this model 1.

The groundwork for the Philosothon was laid in 2007 at Hale School in Perth, Western Australia, through the initiative of Matthew Wills, the Head of Philosophy and Ethics, and Leanne Rucks 1. This inaugural event brought together nine local high school teams, each consisting of five students, for an evening dedicated to philosophical investigation 1. The term 'Philosothon' itself was coined during the initial years of this event at Hale School 1. The success of these early Philosothons led to the first national Australasian event in 2011, hosted by the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations (FAPSA) at Cranbrook School 2. This three-day event included speakers, games, and Communities of Inquiry, with twelve schools participating, representing the winning teams from each Australian state's 2010 Philosothon 2. The Australasian Philosothon has since become an annual event, held in a different region across Australasia each year 1.

The movement also found fertile ground in the United Kingdom, with Mark Smith and Julie Arliss from the Philosophy of Religion and Ethics Department at King's College, Taunton, playing a crucial role in its development, in collaboration with Dr Michael Lacewing from Heythrop College and Lizzy Lewis from Sapere 1. Wells Cathedral College secured the first victory at the UK event 1. The promotion of Philosothons at Academy Conferences events by the UK hub at King's College, Taunton, has further facilitated their spread throughout the UK, with over 375 attendees in the 2019-2020 academic year 1.

Recognizing the educational value of Philosothons, the Templeton Religion Trust awarded significant funding to the Philosothon project in Australasia in 2017 and to the Ian Ramsey Centre at Oxford University in 2019 to support the growth and establishment of new Philosothons, particularly in remote schools and those catering to students from low socio-economic backgrounds 1. This financial support underscores the perceived importance of these events in promoting higher-order thinking skills and engagement with philosophy across diverse student populations. Beyond secondary schools, Philosothons are also organized for junior and primary school students, sometimes in collaboration with institutions like art galleries, demonstrating the adaptability of the format to different age groups 1. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 necessitated a shift to online formats, with the Australasian Association of Philosophy successfully running the first online Philosothon, involving twenty-one schools from Australia and New Zealand 1. This transition highlights the resilience and continued relevance of the Philosothon model in the face of unforeseen circumstances.

The early adoption and sustained expansion of Philosothons across different regions and educational levels indicate a strong recognition of their value within the educational community. This widespread acceptance suggests that the format effectively addresses the need for engaging and challenging activities that promote philosophical inquiry and critical thinking among students. Furthermore, the ability of the Philosothon model to adapt to an online environment demonstrates its fundamental soundness and potential for continued reach and accessibility, irrespective of geographical or logistical constraints.

### **Typical Structure and Schedule**

A Philosothon is typically structured around a series of philosophical discussions known as Communities of Inquiry (COI) 1. These discussions, often four in number, form the core activity of the event. They are usually facilitated by individuals with a background in philosophy or education, such as teachers, university philosophy students, or those holding a PhD 1. The event often takes place on a specific evening each year, bringing together students, teachers, and parents in a focused environment dedicated to philosophical exploration 1. However, variations in this schedule exist, as exemplified by the inaugural Australasian Philosothon in 2011, which was a more extensive three-day event featuring speakers, philosophical games, and multiple COI sessions 2.

The London Philosothon, which specifically catered to primary schools, adopted a structure involving philosophical debates within groups divided into inner and outer circles 3. Each circle would take turns addressing a philosophical question and commenting on the other group's discussion, with a philosophy graduate acting as the facilitator to guide the inquiry 3. This event comprised several parallel sessions held over a few hours, including breaks for lunch, and concluded with an awards ceremony 3.

In the context of the Australasian Philosothon, each COI group typically consists of eight students 5. Each of these inquiry sessions usually runs for a duration of 40 minutes, providing ample time for students to delve into the chosen philosophical questions 6. The structure emphasizes active participation and the collaborative exploration of ideas.

The central role of the Community of Inquiry model in Philosothons highlights the emphasis on the process of philosophical discussion as a means of learning and skill development. Unlike events that might focus on delivering a specific output or solution, Philosothons prioritize the engagement in philosophical dialogue and the cultivation of thinking skills through this interactive format. The flexibility observed in the schedule, ranging from single-evening events to multi-day programs, indicates that organizers can adapt the duration and complexity of the Philosothon to suit their specific resources, the age group of the participants, and the overarching goals of the event.

### **Deliverables**

The traditional Philosothon does not typically emphasize tangible "deliverables" in the same way as a hackathon or project-based competition 1. Instead, the primary focus is on the active participation of students in the philosophical discussions and the quality of their engagement within the Communities of Inquiry 1. The London Philosothon, for instance, considered participation as the main deliverable, although individual students could also receive recognition for specific contributions to the discussions, such as the intelligent use of counter-examples or the introduction of thought experiments 3.

However, in the lead-up to the Australasian Philosothon, students from participating schools are expected to engage in a preparatory phase where they study the provided topic questions and generate their own open-ended questions related to these topics 5. This process of question formulation can be seen as a form of preparatory deliverable, ensuring that students come to the event with a foundation of thought and inquiry related to the discussion themes.

The emphasis on participation and the process of philosophical inquiry, rather than on a final product or presentation, distinguishes Philosothons from other competitive academic events like hackathons. This focus underscores the value placed on developing students' thinking and communication skills in real-time through dynamic and collaborative discussions.

### **Time Allocation**

The amount of time allocated for different components of a Philosothon can vary depending on the specific event. However, a common pattern involves individual discussion rounds within the Communities of Inquiry lasting for a focused period. For example, it is suggested that the discussion of each topic in a Philosothon should typically run for 15 to 20 minutes, with appropriate breaks interspersed between sessions 7. In the Australasian Philosothon, each COI session is scheduled for a duration of 40 minutes, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of the philosophical questions 6. The London Philosothon, designed for primary school students, featured several parallel sessions that took place over a few hours, indicating a more condensed format suitable for younger participants 3. In contrast, a hackathon like the Marietta College PioSolve allocates a continuous block of six hours (from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm) for teams to work on developing their solutions 8.

The relatively short duration of individual discussion rounds in a Philosothon encourages students to make focused and concise contributions to the conversation. This time constraint likely aims to maintain engagement and ensure that all participants have an opportunity to share their perspectives without the discussions becoming protracted or losing focus. The overall length of the Philosothon event itself can range from a few hours, as seen in the London Philosothon, to a full day or even longer, depending on the number of discussion rounds and any additional activities included in the program.

### **Group Formation**

The way in which participants are organized into groups for a Philosothon is often carefully considered to maximize interaction and the diversity of perspectives within each Community of Inquiry. At the first Philosothon held at Hale School, teams consisted of five students from each participating school 1. The structure of the Australasian Philosothon involves each school sending a team of five students, typically one from each of Years 8 to 11, along with a reserve student from one of these year levels 5. During the event, mixed-year-level groups are often utilized for some of the discussion rounds, fostering interaction between students with varying levels of experience and philosophical understanding 5.

A key element of group formation in the Australasian Philosothon is that each COI group includes one student from each of the participating schools 6. This deliberate mixing of students from different educational institutions is intended to broaden the range of perspectives brought to the discussions and encourage collaboration among individuals who may not have previously interacted. Generally, discussion groups in a Philosothon tend to have around 7 to 8 students, a size that is considered conducive to meaningful dialogue and ensures that each participant has an opportunity to contribute 7.

The practice of deliberately mixing students from different schools and sometimes different age levels in Philosothon groups serves to cultivate a richer and more varied intellectual environment. This approach encourages participants to engage with a wider array of viewpoints and to develop their ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences.

### **Workshops and Preparation**

Preparation plays a crucial role in enabling students to participate effectively in a Philosothon. The underlying rationale for the event is supported by empirical evidence indicating that teaching reasoning skills early in life significantly enhances other cognitive and academic abilities, thereby improving learning in general 1. To facilitate meaningful engagement, students are typically provided with the philosophical questions and some stimulus reading materials in advance of the Philosothon 1. In the case of the Australasian Philosothon, participating schools receive a comprehensive resource pack containing the topic questions to be discussed as early as three months before the event 5. This generous lead time allows students to study the materials, schools to select their contestants, practice discussing the questions, and for students to formulate their own open-ended questions on the topics 5.

For students who may be new to the Community of Inquiry process, preparatory coaching is often essential to ensure they understand what is expected of them during the discussions 7. The Cambridge Philosothon is explicitly described as a workshop format, suggesting a strong emphasis on learning and skill development alongside the competitive aspect 11. Additionally, organizations like Philosophy Matters offer student workshops that cover a range of philosophical themes and contemporary issues, which can serve as valuable preparation for a Philosothon 12. Furthermore, to ensure the smooth operation of Philosothons, training is often organized for PhD students to equip them with the necessary skills to act as facilitators for the Communities of Inquiry 13.

The provision of pre-event materials and the potential inclusion of workshops underscore the importance of equipping students with the foundational knowledge and skills required to participate meaningfully in a Philosothon. This preparation ensures that students can approach the philosophical discussions with confidence and engage in a more thoughtful and rigorous manner.

### **Judging Process and Judges**

The judging process in a Philosothon is a critical component that aims to evaluate the quality of students' philosophical thinking and their engagement in the collaborative inquiry. Students participating in a Philosothon are typically assessed by university-based professional philosophers during the Community of Inquiry discussions 1. These judges award scores based on the rigor and clarity of the students' thought as demonstrated during the discussions 1. Often, philosophy lecturers from local universities volunteer their time and expertise to serve as judges for these events 1.

In the London Philosothon, the judging criteria extended beyond mere philosophical brilliance to also consider the students' ability to collaborate and support their peers within the discussion groups 3. Judges were instructed to look for examples of facilitation and support, which were considered to warrant good marks alongside insightful philosophical contributions 3. Furthermore, individual students in the London Philosothon could also be recognized with medals for specific philosophical skills demonstrated, such as the intelligent use of counter-examples or the effective deployment of thought experiments 3.

For the Australasian Philosothon, judges utilize a detailed rubric to score students' contributions across three key categories: critical thinking, creative thinking, and collaborative thinking 4. This rubric provides a structured framework for evaluating various aspects of a student's participation, including their ability to grasp philosophical problems, construct arguments, evaluate others' arguments, contribute original ideas, make connections between ideas, and engage respectfully with their peers 4. Behaviors such as grandstanding, dominating the discussion, and exhibiting poor listening skills are typically marked down, while actions like facilitating the discussion, questioning assumptions, drawing others into the dialogue, and linking or developing ideas are viewed favorably and contribute to higher scores 14.

The involvement of university-level philosophers as judges brings a level of expertise and credibility to the Philosothon, ensuring that the evaluation of students' philosophical engagement is grounded in recognized academic standards. The judging criteria, which emphasize not only individual philosophical acumen but also collaborative and communicative abilities, reflect the core principles of the Community of Inquiry model and the importance of a cooperative approach to philosophical exploration.

### **Organizational Information**

Philosothons are organized annually in various regions, including all Australian states, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, indicating a well-established and recurring event structure 1. Often, regional Philosothons are held, with the winning school teams progressing to national-level events such as the Australasian Philosothon 1. King's College, Taunton, serves as a significant hub for Philosothon activities in the UK, facilitating the spread and organization of these events 1. In some instances, primary school Philosothons are organized in collaboration with institutions like art galleries, suggesting a creative approach to engaging younger students with philosophical inquiry in diverse settings 1.

The Australasian Association of Philosophy demonstrated the adaptability of the format by running the first online Philosothon in 2020, responding to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic 1. Participating schools in the Australasian Philosothon receive a resource pack containing essential information and materials for the event 5. A typical organizational structure involves each discussion group having both a facilitator to guide the conversation and a judge to assess the students' engagement 6. Invitations to participate in the prestigious Australasian Philosothon are typically extended to the schools that achieve success in the various regional Philosothons, creating a tiered system of competition and recognition 6.

The tiered structure of Philosothons, from regional to national levels, provides a clear pathway for schools and students to participate and potentially achieve recognition for their philosophical skills. Collaborations with diverse institutions, such as art galleries, indicate a willingness to explore innovative and engaging environments for philosophical inquiry. The successful transition to an online format highlights the flexibility and resilience of the Philosothon model, ensuring its continued accessibility.

### **Potential Challenges in Running Philosothons**

Despite the success and positive impact of Philosothons, organizers may encounter several potential challenges. Criticisms of the competitive format often arise, focusing on procedural issues and the argument that the competitive spirit might inherently undermine the collaborative nature of philosophical inquiry 2. One procedural concern relates to speaker turn-taking during the Community of Inquiry, which can sometimes appear arbitrary compared to the structured turns in a formal debate 4. Additionally, the non-directive role of the facilitator, while intended to empower students, can sometimes lead to discussions that become unfocused or mired in confusion, particularly if the participants have limited philosophical experience 4.

Another significant challenge lies in maintaining objectivity in the scoring process. Judges are tasked with evaluating the complex and dynamic interactions of a group of students using a rubric, which can be demanding and potentially subjective 4. The interpretation of the rubric itself can also vary among judges, leading to inconsistencies in scoring, a common issue in educational assessments 4. Some argue that the very act of ranking individuals in a philosophical event can compromise the development of a genuine Community of Inquiry, where the focus should ideally be on shared understanding rather than individual achievement 2.

Balancing the competitive element with the primary aim of fostering a sense of community and cooperation is a delicate task for Philosothon organizers 6. Ensuring that students approach the event as a discussion rather than a debate requires specific coaching and a clear emphasis on the principles of collaborative philosophical inquiry 7. Facilitators need to be experienced in guiding these types of discussions effectively, intervening when necessary to keep the inquiry on track and ensure that all students have a fair opportunity to participate, without imposing their own views 7.

The inherent tension between competition and the collaborative ideals of philosophical inquiry necessitates careful design and facilitation to ensure that the competitive aspect enhances, rather than detracts from, the learning experience. The subjective nature of assessing philosophical discussions requires clear, well-defined rubrics and adequate training for judges to promote consistency and fairness in evaluations.

## **Philosophy Hackathons: Exploring the Format**

### **Successful Examples and Conceptual Models**

While the term "Philosophy Hackathon" might not be as widely established as "Philosothon," the hackathon format, known for its intensive, collaborative problem-solving approach, can be effectively adapted to philosophical themes. The provided snippets primarily detail general hackathons focused on software, technology, and business innovation 8. However, some examples suggest the potential for philosophy-focused hackathons.

One instance is the "Prompt Engineering Hackathon for Humanities" at Arizona State University (ASU) 59. This event challenged participants to explore the advantages and disadvantages of using AI as a collaborator from a humanities perspective, with the creation of a persona playbook as the main deliverable 59. This example demonstrates how the hackathon format can be used to engage with philosophical questions related to technology and human-computer interaction.

Another compelling model is the idea of transforming Hermann Hesse's "Glass Bead Game" into an AI hackathon 60. The Glass Bead Game, in its original conception, is an intellectual game that synthesizes knowledge across various disciplines such as mathematics, art, science, philosophy, and music 60. An AI hackathon based on this concept could involve participants developing digital platforms or AI tools that facilitate the creative connection and synthesis of concepts across these diverse fields 60. Potential deliverables could include AI-powered "concept cards" or digital "beads" that dynamically interact to form narrative sequences or visualize conceptual connections between seemingly unrelated ideas 60.

Beyond these examples, a Philosophy Hackathon could also focus on developing AI tools for ethical analysis, creating digital resources for philosophical research, or exploring the philosophical implications of emerging technologies. The core idea is to leverage the collaborative and intensive nature of a hackathon to tackle philosophical problems or explore philosophical concepts through innovative and often technology-driven approaches.

The integration of philosophical inquiry with the dynamic format of a hackathon presents a unique opportunity to attract students with a broad range of skills and interests, bridging the gap between humanities and technology. The "Glass Bead Game" concept, in particular, offers a rich framework for a Philosophy Hackathon that emphasizes interdisciplinary thinking and creative synthesis, aligning with the expansive nature of philosophical exploration.

### **Typical Structure and Schedule**

The structure and schedule of a Philosophy Hackathon would likely mirror those of general hackathons, with necessary adaptations to suit the philosophical focus. Typically, hackathons are time-bound competitive events where participants collaborate in teams to build proofs of concept or minimum viable products (MVPs) around a specific problem or to innovate within a given theme 23. These events can range in duration from an intense 24 to 48 hours to more extended periods, such as a few days or even weeks for virtual hackathons 18.

A common structure involves an initial phase of registration and team formation, often followed by an ideation stage where participants brainstorm and refine their project ideas 22. The core of the hackathon is the development phase, where teams work intensively to create their deliverables. The event typically culminates in presentations or pitches to a panel of judges, followed by an awards ceremony 22.

The Marietta College PioSolve hackathon provides an example of a condensed, one-day schedule 8. The program included an introduction, a statement of the problem and rules, team selection, a six-hour block for teams to develop solutions, time for uploading presentation slides, and finally, team pitches to the judges 8. In contrast, the ASU Prompt Engineering Hackathon was held over two days, with the first day focusing on welcome, introductions to materials, prompt exercises, teaming, and an introduction to the challenge, followed by dedicated work time on the second day, culminating in a pitch competition, judging, and awards 59. Virtual hackathons, like the one organized by Consensys, can have much longer durations, running over three months entirely online to provide greater flexibility for participants worldwide 18.

Adapting this framework for a Philosophy Hackathon would involve setting a clear philosophical challenge or theme, allowing time for participants to research and discuss philosophical concepts, and providing a structured schedule for the development of their chosen deliverables, whether they be arguments, frameworks, or digital tools. The choice between an in-person and a virtual format would also influence the schedule and the types of interactions possible.

The time-bound nature of the hackathon format encourages participants in a Philosophy Hackathon to focus their efforts and rapidly develop their philosophical ideas and projects. The flexibility in scheduling allows organizers to tailor the event to the specific scope of the philosophical challenge and the desired level of engagement.

### **Deliverables**

The deliverables for a Philosophy Hackathon would need to be carefully defined to align with the event's philosophical goals and the chosen format. In general hackathons, common deliverables include proofs of concept, minimum viable products (MVPs), software prototypes, presentations, and slide decks 22. For a Philosophy Hackathon, these could be adapted to include well-reasoned philosophical arguments on a specific topic, ethical frameworks for addressing a particular issue, proposals for applying philosophical principles to a real-world problem, or even digital tools that embody or explore philosophical concepts 60.

The Prompt Engineering Hackathon at ASU, for example, required participants to create a "persona playbook" that expressed their discoveries about the capabilities and limitations of AI as a collaborator from a humanities perspective 59. This deliverable focused on articulating insights and boundaries in the context of human-machine synergy. The "Glass Bead Game" hackathon concept suggests deliverables such as AI-powered "concept cards" or digital platforms that visually map conceptual connections across different fields, emphasizing interdisciplinary synthesis 60. Policy hackathons often require participants to produce a concise policy brief and a pitch presentation outlining their proposed solutions 27.

When designing a Philosophy Hackathon, it is crucial to define clear and achievable deliverables that encourage participants to engage deeply with philosophical concepts and apply their understanding in a creative and meaningful way. Providing examples or templates for the expected deliverables can help to guide participants and ensure that the final outputs are aligned with the event's objectives. The nature of the deliverables can vary widely, allowing organizers to tailor the hackathon to specific areas of philosophy or interdisciplinary themes, depending on the desired learning outcomes and the skills of the anticipated participants.

### **Time Allocation**

The time allocated for a Philosophy Hackathon, similar to other hackathons, typically falls within a range of 24 to 48 hours for the main development period 20. However, the duration can be adjusted based on the complexity of the philosophical challenge and the expected deliverables. Some hackathons may be shorter, such as the one-day format of the Marietta College PioSolve event 8, while others, particularly virtual ones, can extend over several weeks or even months, like the three-month Consensys virtual hackathon 18. The ASU Prompt Engineering Hackathon provided dedicated work time for participants on both the Friday evening and the Saturday of the event 59. The MIT policy hackathon gave teams a focused 24-hour period to brainstorm, analyze, and develop their solutions, culminating in a policy brief and a pitch presentation 27.

When planning a Philosophy Hackathon, organizers should carefully consider the scope of the philosophical problem and the type of deliverables expected from the participants. For challenges that require in-depth research, complex argumentation, or the development of digital tools, a longer timeframe might be necessary. Conversely, for more focused exercises or ideation challenges, a shorter duration might suffice. It is also important to factor in time for initial introductions, team formation, workshops (if included), presentations, and judging when determining the overall schedule of the event. The time constraints inherent in the hackathon format are intended to encourage efficient work habits and the ability to produce meaningful output under pressure, fostering a dynamic and engaging environment for philosophical exploration.

### **Group Formation**

Collaboration is a central element of the hackathon experience, and Philosophy Hackathons would typically involve participants working together in teams 23. Teams are often formed at the beginning of the event, sometimes through self-selection based on shared interests or around pre-existing project ideas 8. In some cases, hackathons include pitching sessions where individuals can present their ideas and recruit team members who are interested in contributing to those projects 28.

For a Philosophy Hackathon, it is often beneficial to encourage the formation of teams with diverse skill sets 28. This could mean bringing together students with strengths in logical argumentation, critical thinking, philosophical writing, and potentially technology or design, depending on the nature of the hackathon's theme and the expected deliverables. For instance, a hackathon focused on developing a digital tool for ethical decision-making would benefit from having team members with both philosophical and technical expertise.

Organizers can facilitate effective team formation by providing opportunities for participants to network and connect with others who have complementary skills or shared interests. This could involve icebreaker activities, designated time for team formation, or a platform where participants can indicate their skills and project interests. Allowing individuals to join pre-formed teams or to propose their own project ideas and recruit team members can also be effective strategies. For a Philosophy Hackathon, teams that bring together a variety of academic backgrounds and perspectives are likely to foster a richer exploration of the philosophical problems and lead to more innovative and well-rounded outcomes.

### **Workshops and Training**

Incorporating workshops and training sessions into a Philosophy Hackathon can significantly enhance the participants' learning experience and the quality of their deliverables 19. These sessions can provide participants with valuable knowledge and skills relevant to the hackathon's theme and challenges. For a Philosophy Hackathon, relevant workshop topics could include logical argumentation and reasoning, ethical frameworks and analysis, philosophical writing and communication, and the use of digital tools for philosophical research or presentation. If the hackathon has a specific focus, such as the intersection of philosophy and artificial intelligence, workshops on topics like AI ethics or prompt engineering would be highly beneficial, as seen in the ASU Prompt Engineering Hackathon which included an "Intro to materials" and "Prompt exercises" 59.

The timing of these workshops can vary; some might be offered at the beginning of the hackathon to provide foundational knowledge, while others could be scheduled throughout the event to address specific needs or challenges that arise during the development process. Mentors with expertise in relevant areas can also play a crucial role in providing guidance and support to the teams as they work on their projects 22. By offering targeted workshops and making mentors available, organizers can ensure that participants in a Philosophy Hackathon have the resources and support they need to engage effectively with the philosophical challenges and produce high-quality outcomes.

### **Judging Process and Judges**

The judging process for a Philosophy Hackathon should be carefully designed to evaluate the philosophical merit and quality of the participants' work. While general hackathon judging criteria often include creativity, technical execution, functionality, problem-solving, impact, and the final pitch 30, a Philosophy Hackathon would place a greater emphasis on the logical rigor of arguments, the clarity of philosophical concepts, the originality of ideas, and the depth of analysis. If the hackathon involves a technological component, criteria related to the effective use of technology and user experience would also be relevant, as suggested by the "Glass Bead Game" hackathon concept which includes user experience in its evaluation criteria 60.

The selection of judges is crucial for ensuring a fair and informed evaluation process. For a Philosophy Hackathon, the judging panel should ideally include individuals with expertise in philosophy, such as philosophy professors, ethicists, and researchers in relevant fields. If the hackathon has an interdisciplinary focus, such as the ethics of artificial intelligence, it would be beneficial to include judges with expertise in both philosophy and the related field (e.g., AI developers, computer scientists). Clear and well-defined judging criteria should be communicated to the participants in advance, outlining the key aspects on which their projects will be evaluated. This transparency helps participants to focus their efforts and understand what constitutes a successful outcome in the context of the Philosophy Hackathon.

### **Organizational Information**

Organizing a successful Philosophy Hackathon requires careful planning and attention to various logistical and programmatic details. Similar to organizing any hackathon, this involves defining the specific goals and theme of the event, recruiting participants and mentors, establishing clear rules and guidelines, and determining the judging criteria 22. For a Philosophy Hackathon, the core focus will be on identifying a compelling philosophical problem or theme that will engage participants and inspire innovative approaches. This might involve framing a broad ethical challenge, exploring the philosophical implications of a new technology, or asking participants to develop a philosophical framework for a particular domain.

Recruiting participants for a Philosophy Hackathon might involve targeting students in philosophy programs, humanities departments, and interdisciplinary programs that combine philosophy with other fields like computer science or cognitive science. Utilizing online platforms and social media can be effective ways to reach a wider audience 28. Organizers should also consider recruiting mentors with expertise in philosophy and any related fields relevant to the hackathon's theme.

Choosing the appropriate format for the hackathon, whether in-person, virtual, or hybrid, will influence the organizational requirements. For virtual events, selecting a suitable online platform that supports team collaboration, communication, and project submission is essential 61. Regardless of the format, providing clear and timely communication to participants about the hackathon's goals, schedule, rules, and deliverables is crucial for ensuring a focused and productive event.

### **Potential Challenges in Running Philosophy Hackathons**

Organizing a Philosophy Hackathon presents several unique challenges that organizers should be prepared to address. One significant challenge is defining "deliverables" that are both philosophically meaningful and achievable within the typically short timeframe of a hackathon 20. Unlike software or hardware hackathons where the outputs are often tangible products or prototypes, the deliverables for a Philosophy Hackathon might be more abstract, such as well-reasoned arguments or ethical frameworks. Clearly articulating what constitutes a successful philosophical deliverable and providing guidance or examples can help participants to focus their efforts.

Another challenge lies in the judging process. Evaluating the quality and rigor of philosophical work can be more subjective than assessing the functionality of a piece of software. Therefore, it is crucial to have a panel of judges with strong expertise in philosophy and to establish clear judging criteria that emphasize the key aspects of philosophical inquiry, such as logical coherence, conceptual clarity, and originality.

Attracting participants with the right mix of skills can also be a challenge, especially if the Philosophy Hackathon involves a technological component. Organizers might need to target a diverse group of students and individuals from both humanities and technical backgrounds and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration. Ensuring that the focus of the hackathon remains on deep philosophical engagement, rather than becoming a superficial exercise in applying technology to philosophical themes, is another important consideration. Interdisciplinary hackathons, in general, can face challenges related to the limited exchange of best practices and research findings between different fields 40. Organizers of Philosophy Hackathons should be mindful of these potential challenges and proactively develop strategies to mitigate them through careful planning, clear communication, and thoughtful design of the event.

## **Student Feedback and Insights**

### **Feedback on Philosothons**

While direct online feedback from students who have participated in Philosothons might be somewhat limited, existing accounts and related research offer valuable insights into their experiences. Feedback from a population health hackathon, which utilized a design thinking curriculum similar to the inquiry-based approach in Philosothons, highlighted the significant value students placed on the interdisciplinary nature of the event and the diverse expertise within their groups 35. This suggests that the collaborative aspect of Philosothons, where students from different schools and backgrounds come together, is a highly valued component of the experience.

The description of the London Philosothon, though not direct student quotes, indicates that the children involved were deeply committed to the discussions, exhibited courtesy towards their peers, and found the overall experience to be "cool" and "impressive" 3. The fact that an 11-year-old student made insightful philosophical remarks during the event further suggests a high level of engagement and intellectual stimulation 3. Post-event surveys conducted by Philosothon organizers have focused on both procedural aspects of the event and the intrinsic value derived by the participants 4.

However, some feedback from Philosothon participants has noted a potential tension between the competitive element of the event and the core goals of the Community of Inquiry method, which emphasizes collaboration and shared understanding 66. This highlights the importance for organizers to carefully frame the Philosothon to ensure that the competitive aspect does not overshadow the primary aim of fostering genuine philosophical inquiry and mutual learning among the students. Overall, the available feedback suggests that students generally have positive experiences in Philosothons, appreciating the collaborative environment and the opportunity to engage in meaningful philosophical discussions.

### **Transferable Insights from General Hackathon Feedback**

Feedback from general hackathons can also provide transferable insights that could be valuable for improving the format of Philosophy Hackathons. Students often report that they value the opportunity to learn new skills, apply their existing knowledge to solve real-world problems, and network with peers and industry professionals during hackathons 32. The hackathon environment can also serve as a "fail-forward" space where students feel supported in taking risks and learning from their mistakes 36. Participants tend to appreciate clear project scopes, well-defined deadlines, and opportunities to receive constructive feedback on their work 29.

However, feedback also highlights potential challenges, such as difficulties in team dynamics, technical issues encountered during development, and concerns about the relevance or impact of the hackathon projects in a real-world context 20. Inclusivity is another important factor, with participants valuing hackathons that cater to various experience levels and create a welcoming environment for individuals from diverse backgrounds 19. Organizers of Philosophy Hackathons can draw upon these insights by ensuring that the philosophical challenges are clearly defined, that there are ample opportunities for collaboration and learning, and that participants receive support and feedback throughout the event. Addressing potential pitfalls, such as ensuring inclusivity and providing adequate technical or philosophical guidance, can contribute to a more positive and enriching experience for all participants.

## **Organizational Information and Resources for Planning**

### **Defining the Philosophical Problem or Discussion Topics**

Carefully selecting engaging and thought-provoking philosophical questions or problem statements is fundamental to the success of both Philosothons and Philosophy Hackathons. Philosothon questions are typically open-ended, exploring fundamental philosophical concepts across various branches of philosophy, such as ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and political philosophy 1. Examples include questions like "Is it moral to fake kindness?", "Do you have free will?", "What is the nature of the human mind?", and "What is it to live a good life?" 1. Effective philosophical questions should be genuine, not easily dismissed, and should have compelling reasons supporting multiple perspectives 69. Resources like online forums and philosophical discussions can provide inspiration for potential questions 67.

For Philosophy Hackathons, the problem statement should be a concise description of an issue, clearly indicating the current state, the desired outcome, and the gap that needs to be addressed 45. Themes can provide a creative and focused direction for hackathon projects 19. For example, a theme could be "The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence" or "Philosophy and the Digital Age," under which participants could develop specific projects addressing related philosophical problems. When defining the problem statement or theme, it is helpful to consider the desired learning outcomes and the skills of the intended participants 45. Narrowing down the problem through techniques like asking a series of "why" and "how" questions can help to identify the underlying issues and craft a more effective prompt 45.

### **Recruiting Participants and Judges**

Recruitment strategies for Philosothons typically involve reaching out to schools and philosophy teachers, highlighting the educational benefits of participation, such as the development of critical thinking and communication skills 1. Regional Philosothons can serve as entry points, with winning teams advancing to national events 6. Judges are often sought from philosophy departments at universities or other institutions with expertise in philosophical inquiry 1.

For Philosophy Hackathons, recruitment efforts should target students and individuals with an interest in both philosophy and the specific theme of the hackathon (e.g., AI ethics, digital humanities). This might involve reaching out to relevant academic departments, student organizations, and online communities 28. Leveraging social media and hackathon platforms can also be effective 61. Judges for Philosophy Hackathons should include philosophers, ethicists, and potentially experts in the relevant interdisciplinary fields to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the projects 30. Clearly communicating the goals and theme of the hackathon is crucial for attracting the right participants 72.

### **Rules and Guidelines**

Establishing clear rules and guidelines is essential for creating a positive and productive environment in both Philosothons and Philosophy Hackathons. For Philosothons, the rules should emphasize the collaborative nature of philosophical inquiry, encouraging students to listen respectfully, build upon each other's ideas, and ask clarifying questions 6. Grandstanding and interrupting should be discouraged 14. The judging criteria should align with these principles, focusing on the quality of thought, respectful engagement, and collaborative contributions 4. Resources like guidelines for facilitating Communities of Inquiry can be valuable for both participants and facilitators 7.

For Philosophy Hackathons, the rules should clearly define the scope of the projects, the expected deliverables, and the judging criteria 22. Guidelines for team collaboration, intellectual property (if applicable), and submission formats should also be provided. Maintaining a welcoming and inclusive environment should be a priority, with policies in place to address any form of harassment or disrespectful behavior 23. General guidelines for respectful discussion in academic settings can also be adapted for hackathons 75.

### **Cost Considerations**

The cost of organizing a Philosothon or Philosophy Hackathon can vary significantly depending on the scale, format, and resources required. Some Philosothons charge a small participation fee per student to cover costs such as food 76. However, grants and subsidies are often available to support schools, particularly those in regional or low socio-economic areas, to cover costs associated with training, setting up Philosothons, or travel 1. In some cases, organizations or schools may cover all costs internally 79.

For Philosophy Hackathons, potential costs can include venue rental (if in-person), food and refreshments, prizes to incentivize participation, marketing and outreach efforts, and platform fees if using online hackathon platforms 23. Securing sponsorship from relevant organizations or institutions can be a crucial way to offset these costs 25. When planning a Philosophy Hackathon, organizers should develop a detailed budget that accounts for all anticipated expenses and explore potential funding sources to ensure the financial sustainability of the event.

## **Conclusion**

Philosothons and Philosophy Hackathons offer distinct yet valuable approaches to fostering philosophical inquiry, critical thinking, and collaboration among students. Philosothons, with their emphasis on structured philosophical discussions within Communities of Inquiry, provide a platform for developing nuanced thinking and communication skills through dialogue. Philosophy Hackathons, on the other hand, leverage the intensive, project-based format to encourage creative problem-solving and the application of philosophical concepts to real-world challenges, often incorporating technology.

Both formats present unique organizational considerations and potential challenges. For Philosothons, balancing competition with collaboration and ensuring fair and objective judging are key. For Philosophy Hackathons, clearly defining philosophical deliverables and attracting participants with diverse skill sets are important factors for success. Student feedback indicates that the collaborative and interdisciplinary aspects of these events are highly valued, contributing to positive learning experiences.

Educators and organizers interested in implementing Philosothons or Philosophy Hackathons should focus on careful planning, clear communication of goals and guidelines, and a commitment to creating an enriching and supportive environment for all participants. By drawing upon the examples, insights, and resources outlined in this report, organizers can effectively design and execute these innovative events, fostering a deeper engagement with philosophy and developing essential skills for students' academic and personal growth.
