# Expanded Theme Description: Digital Ethics: Beyond Utilitarian Frameworks

## Overview

Digital ethics examines the moral dimensions of digital technologies and the communities, practices, and social structures they enable. This theme challenges students to move beyond simple consequentialist calculations (maximizing benefits, minimizing harms) that often dominate tech ethics discussions toward richer ethical frameworks that can better capture our moral intuitions about digital technologies. By engaging with virtue ethics, deontological approaches, care ethics, and other frameworks, this theme explores how different ethical traditions might illuminate distinctive moral concerns in digital contexts—from questions of justice and rights to character formation and human flourishing.

## Historical Context

While philosophical ethics has ancient roots, digital ethics emerged as a distinct field in the late 20th century as computing technologies became increasingly embedded in daily life. Early computer ethics, pioneered by scholars like Norbert Wiener in "The Human Use of Human Beings" (1950) and later Joseph Weizenbaum in "Computer Power and Human Reason" (1976), raised concerns about automation, decision-making, and human dignity.

The 1980s and 1990s saw more systematic development of computer ethics as a field, notably through James Moor's influential "What is Computer Ethics?" (1985) and Deborah Johnson's "Computer Ethics" (1985), which applied traditional ethical frameworks to new technological contexts. These early approaches often employed consequentialist analyses, weighing potential benefits against harms.

The internet's rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s generated new ethical questions around privacy, intellectual property, free expression, and community formation. As digital technologies penetrated more aspects of life, scholars began recognizing that digital ethics couldn't be treated as a niche application of ethics but required fundamental reconsideration of ethical frameworks themselves.

By the 2010s, with the rise of social media platforms, big data analytics, and increasingly sophisticated AI, digital ethics gained new urgency, reflected in institutional initiatives like university centers for tech ethics, corporate ethics boards, and government commission reports. This period also saw growing recognition of the limitations of purely consequentialist approaches and renewed interest in alternative frameworks.

## Key Debates

This theme encompasses several interconnected debates:

1.  **Ethical frameworks**: Which ethical traditions best capture our moral intuitions about digital technologies?
2.  **Digital virtues**: What virtues are especially relevant for flourishing in digital contexts?
3.  **Rights and justice**: How should we understand rights, fairness, and justice in digital environments?
4.  **Care and relationality**: How do digital technologies transform care relationships and ethical responsibilities?
5.  **Design ethics**: What ethical principles should guide the design of digital systems?

## Analytic Tradition

Analytic philosophers have engaged digital ethics through precise concept analysis, systematic ethical theory application, and careful examination of moral principles.

**John Rawls'** theory of "justice as fairness" from "A Theory of Justice" (1971) provides a framework for evaluating the fairness of digital systems and institutions. His "veil of ignorance" thought experiment suggests that just digital systems would distribute benefits and burdens in ways that don't systematically disadvantage any particular group.

**T.M. Scanlon's** contractualism, developed in "What We Owe to Each Other" (1998), offers principles for evaluating when actions or policies are wrong based on their reasonable rejectability. This approach illuminates why consent mechanisms in digital contexts might be insufficient if they rely on terms no one could reasonably be expected to read or understand.

**Shannon Vallor's** "Technology and the Virtues" (2016) represents a major contribution to digital virtue ethics, identifying "technomoral virtues" particularly relevant to living well with emerging technologies. Virtues like honesty, justice, courage, care, moderation, humility, and perspective become especially salient in digital contexts that can otherwise encourage moral fragmentation.

**Luciano Floridi** develops an "information ethics" in works like "The Ethics of Information" (2013), arguing that digital technologies require us to reconceptualize moral patients as "inforgs"—informational organisms in an "infosphere." This ontological approach extends moral consideration beyond traditional boundaries to include informational entities.

## Continental Tradition

Continental philosophers have approached digital ethics through phenomenology, critical theory, and analyses of technology's role in shaping ethical subjectivity.

**Emmanuel Levinas'** ethics of the Other, articulated in works like "Totality and Infinity" (1961), emphasizes infinite responsibility to the other person as prior to any ethical system. This perspective raises critical questions about how digital mediation transforms face-to-face encounters and potentially diminishes our sense of responsibility to others.

**Hans Jonas** develops an "imperative of responsibility" in "The Imperative of Responsibility" (1979), arguing that modern technology's unprecedented power requires an expanded ethics concerned with future generations. His perspective is particularly relevant to questions of sustainability and long-term impacts of digital infrastructures.

**Bernard Stiegler** analyzes technology's "pharmacological" nature in works like "Taking Care of Youth and the Generations" (2008)—functioning simultaneously as both poison and cure. This perspective illuminates how digital technologies can both support and undermine human flourishing, requiring ongoing care and attention rather than simple acceptance or rejection.

**María Puig de la Bellacasa** develops a feminist ethics of care for technological worlds in "Matters of Care" (2017), arguing that care should be understood as both affective concern and material practice. This approach highlights often-invisible forms of care work in maintaining digital infrastructures and communities.

## Intersection and Tensions

While analytic approaches often seek to develop systematic frameworks for evaluating the ethics of digital technologies, continental approaches typically emphasize how technologies transform the conditions for ethical life itself. These perspectives can complement each other: analytic clarity about principles and consequences helps articulate specific ethical requirements, while continental analyses reveal how technologies shape the background conditions within which ethical judgments are formed.

Both traditions recognize limitations in purely consequentialist approaches to digital ethics, though for somewhat different reasons. Analytic critics emphasize how consequentialism may fail to respect rights, overlook distributive concerns, or neglect character and virtue, while continental critics may focus on how consequentialism presupposes an inappropriate instrumentalist orientation toward technology itself.

## Contemporary Relevance

As digital technologies penetrate more aspects of human life—from intimate relationships to civic participation, education to healthcare—developing adequate ethical frameworks becomes increasingly urgent. The limitations of purely consequentialist approaches have become especially apparent with social media platforms that optimize for engagement metrics at the expense of individual well-being and social cohesion.

The rapid development of AI systems raises particularly pressing questions that resist simple consequentialist analysis: questions about human dignity, agency, responsibility, care, justice, and flourishing. As these systems grow more capable and autonomous, we need ethical frameworks that can address not just outcomes but the transformation of human identity, relationships, and societies.

Digital ethics is no longer a specialized domain but increasingly central to ethics as a whole, as more of human life becomes digitally mediated. The philosophical questions at the heart of this theme—about values, virtues, justice, care, and flourishing—matter not just for academic clarity but for designing and governing technologies that support rather than undermine human goods.
