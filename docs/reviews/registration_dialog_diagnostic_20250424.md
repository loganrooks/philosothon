# RegistrationDialog Diagnostic Report

**Date:** 2025-04-24 12:01 PM ET
**Branch:** `feature/registration-v3.1-impl`
**Commit:** `3fa31c0ccc875c14f81a32f10f725b6aae50dc1e` (within `platform/`)
**Reviewer:** Holistic Reviewer Mode

## 1. Objective

Evaluate the current state of the `RegistrationDialog` feature (code, tests, schema, generated data) against key project documents (`registration_outline.md`, `terminal_component_v2.md`, `project_specifications_v3.md`) to provide a clear diagnostic report and identify the most critical next step, following user request for clarification and deeper investigation.

## 2. Summary of Findings & Recommendations

The `RegistrationDialog` feature shows significant progress towards the V3.1 specification. The core data definition (schema) and generated question data are synchronized and accurately reflect the requirements outline. The component implements the early authentication flow, most input types, and command handling.

However, the **primary blocker remains the unstable test suite (`RegistrationDialog.test.tsx`)**. Verification confirms **8 failing tests** and **33 skipped tests**. The failures are primarily due to **incorrect/fragile test assertions and setup issues** (especially around mocked confirmation flow), not critical component bugs (boolean validation logic confirmed correct). Recent Memory Bank logs claiming syntax errors block execution are **inaccurate**. Significant **code duplication** exists in ranking tests.

This test instability prevents reliable verification and blocks further TDD for unimplemented features like `ranked-choice-numbered`.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **(Highest Priority):** Delegate fixing `RegistrationDialog.test.tsx` to **`tdd` mode**.
    *   **Task:** Correct the 8 failing test assertions (focus on confirmation flow mocks, output line checks). Remove duplicated `ranking-numbered` test block (lines ~1649-1871). Address assertion fragility. Ensure 24 currently passing tests remain passing.
2.  **(Next Step):** Delegate implementing `ranked-choice-numbered` handling in `RegistrationDialog.tsx` and writing corresponding tests (filling `it.todo`) to **`tdd` mode**, *after* tests are stabilized.
3.  **(Lower Priority):** Implement real backend logic for email confirmation/resend; refine `FormDataStore` types.

## 3. Detailed Analysis

### 3.1. Git Status
*   Current Commit: `3fa31c0ccc875c14f81a32f10f725b6aae50dc1e`

### 3.2. Documentation Context
*   Reviewed:
    *   `docs/project_specifications_v3.md`
    *   `docs/architecture/terminal_component_v2.md`
    *   `docs/event_info/registration_outline.md`
    *   `docs/plans/phase_3_plan.md`
    *   `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
    *   `memory-bank/globalContext.md`
*   Assessment: Documents are consistent regarding V3.1 requirements, Terminal UI architecture, and SSOT strategy.

### 3.3. Schema (`platform/config/registrationSchema.ts`)
*   **Status:** **Synchronized & Accurate.**
*   **Details:**
    *   Defines 48 steps (36 numbered questions + implicit 'Other' fields + inserted 'universityInstitution').
    *   Accurately reflects `registration_outline.md` structure, types (incl. `ranked-choice-numbered`), validation rules, hints, descriptions, dependencies.
    *   Includes `universityInstitution` at order 8.
    *   Contains placeholder `generateRegistrationSchema` function for script use.

### 3.4. Generated Data (`platform/src/app/register/data/registrationQuestions.ts`)
*   **Status:** **Synchronized.**
*   **Details:**
    *   `questions` array accurately mirrors `registrationSchema.ts` structure and content.
    *   `FormDataStore` type uses `any` placeholders (marked TODO).
    *   Confirms generation script likely ran successfully post-schema update.

### 3.5. Component (`platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.tsx`)
*   **Status:** **Partially Implemented.**
*   **Implemented Features:**
    *   State Management: `useReducer` for core state.
    *   Modes: `intro`, `early_auth`, `questioning`, `awaiting_confirmation`, `review`, `success`, `error`.
    *   Early Auth: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password flow implemented, calls `initiateOtpSignIn`.
    *   Commands: `back`, `review`, `help`, `save`, `exit`, `edit [n]` logic present.
    *   Input Handling: Logic exists for `text`, `textarea`, `email`, `boolean`, `single-select`, `scale`, `multi-select-numbered`.
    *   Validation: Basic client-side validation implemented for handled types based on schema rules. Boolean validation logic confirmed correct.
    *   Skip Logic: Basic `dependsOn`/`dependsValue` check implemented.
*   **Missing/Incomplete Features:**
    *   `ranked-choice-numbered`: No specific logic to parse/validate "OptionNumber:Rank" format.
    *   Email Confirmation: `checkConfirmationStatus` uses a placeholder returning `false`. Resend logic is placeholder/missing.
    *   Complex Skip Logic: May not handle all `dependsOn` scenarios (e.g., checking if 'Other' is selected in a multi-select array).

### 3.6. Tests (`platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationDialog.test.tsx`)
*   **Status:** **Unstable - Needs Urgent Fixing.**
*   **Execution:** Runs (24 passed, 8 failed, 33 skipped). **No syntax errors found.**
*   **Detailed Failure Analysis (8 Failures):**
    1.  `Early Auth > transition to questioning...`: Fails due to mock `checkConfirmationStatus` returning `false`. Assertion expects success state. (Test setup/assertion issue).
    2.  `Question Flow > display first question...`: Fails for the same reason; never reaches 'questioning' state. (Test setup/assertion issue).
    3.  `Question Flow > validate required text...`: Fails `toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(prompt)`. Component re-prompts, but hint is last output. (Assertion fragility).
    4.  `Question Flow > validate boolean input... (x2)`: Fails assertion expecting error message. Component logic *is* correct, but test doesn't correctly detect the error output. (Test assertion issue). *Test is duplicated.*
    5.  `Question Flow > handle multi-select-numbered...`: Fails assertion expecting options re-display. Component correctly advances. (Test assertion issue).
    6.  `Command Handling > handle "review"...`: Fails assertion expecting specific footer line. Component outputs summary/re-prompt correctly. (Assertion fragility).
    7.  `Command Handling > handle "help"...`: Fails assertion expecting exact help message. Component outputs help correctly. (Assertion fragility/formatting).
    8.  `Command Handling > invalid "edit" format...`: Fails `toHaveBeenLastCalledWith(prompt)`. Component re-prompts, but hint is last output. (Assertion fragility).
*   **Skipped Tests (33):** Mostly `it.todo` placeholders for unimplemented features (commands, local storage, backend actions, `ranked-choice-numbered` validation), aligning with spec.
*   **Code Hygiene:** Significant duplication in ranking test blocks (lines ~1423-1871). The `ranking-numbered` block is redundant and targets the wrong question index.
*   **Workarounds:** Uses REG-TEST-TIMING-001 workarounds (avoiding assertions on next prompt).

## 4. Loose Threads / Further Investigation Needed

*   **Confirmation Flow Success Path:** While the component handles the *failure* path of email confirmation (due to the mock), the success path (where `checkConfirmationStatus` would return `true`) is effectively untested. Fixing the failing tests related to this requires adjusting mocks or implementing the real check.
*   **Boolean Validation Test Assertion:** The test for boolean validation failure needs correction to properly detect the error message output by the component.

## 5. Conclusion & Next Steps

The `RegistrationDialog` feature is structurally sound regarding data definition and has partial component implementation. The immediate and critical blocker is the unstable test suite. Fixing the failing tests (primarily assertion/setup issues) and cleaning up duplication is essential before TDD can reliably continue for the remaining features, notably `ranked-choice-numbered` input handling.

**Recommended Next Step:** Delegate test suite stabilization (fixing 8 failures, removing duplication) to **`tdd` mode**.
