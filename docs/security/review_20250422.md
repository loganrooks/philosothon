# Security Review Report - 2025-04-22

**Branch:** `feature/security-review` (Based on `main`)
**Commit at time of review:** `e42fe66` (after MB updates)

## 1. Summary of Findings

This security review focused on common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 relevant aspects), secrets management, Supabase integration (Auth, RLS, client usage), dependency vulnerabilities, and general code structure based on the task requirements.

*   **No critical vulnerabilities** (e.g., hardcoded secrets, SQL injection paths, missing authentication on critical routes) were identified in the reviewed code sections.
*   **Dependencies:** `npm audit` reported **0 vulnerabilities**.
*   **Secrets Management:** Code correctly utilizes environment variables (`.env.local`, Vercel variables) for Supabase credentials. No secrets were found hardcoded in the repository.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) correctly protects `/admin` routes based on user authentication status and role (`admin`) fetched from the `profiles` table via the DAL.
    *   Server Actions (`auth/actions.ts`, `register/actions.ts`) properly use the server-side Supabase client and rely on user ID for operations, implicitly leveraging RLS.
*   **RLS Policies:** Policies reviewed (`supabase/migrations/20250422151859_enable_rls_core_tables.sql`) appear robust, enforcing least privilege for users (access only own data) and preventing role self-elevation. Admin access is correctly gated via a role check (assuming `get_my_role()` is secure).
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **`RegistrationForm.tsx` Complexity:** This component (1125 lines) is significantly oversized and handles too many responsibilities, making it difficult to maintain and audit. (Severity: Low/Medium - Maintainability/Risk)
    *   **Client-Side Validation:** Input validation is largely missing in `RegistrationForm.tsx`. (Severity: Low - Primarily UX/Data Integrity, but could contribute to issues if server validation fails)
    *   **Local Storage:** Registration data is stored in plain text in local storage. While not directly exploitable without another vulnerability (like XSS), it increases the impact if such a vulnerability exists. Obfuscation or minimizing stored data is recommended. (Severity: Low)
    *   **Schema Inconsistency:** Mismatches noted between Zod schema (V2) used in `register/actions.ts` and the DAL input type (`RegistrationInput` - V1.1) add complexity and risk of data mapping errors. (Severity: Low - Maintainability/Data Integrity)

## 2. Files Reviewed

*   `platform/package.json` (via `npm audit`)
*   `platform/src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
*   `platform/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
*   `platform/src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`
*   `platform/src/middleware.ts`
*   `supabase/migrations/20250422151859_enable_rls_core_tables.sql` (via `git show`)
*   `platform/src/app/register/components/RegistrationForm.tsx`
*   `platform/src/app/register/actions.ts`
*   `platform/src/app/auth/actions.ts`
*   `platform/src/lib/data/profiles.ts`
*   `platform/src/lib/data/registrations.ts`
*   Searched `platform/` and `supabase/` for secrets patterns.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Refactor `RegistrationForm.tsx`:** Prioritize refactoring this component into smaller, modular pieces as per the "Modular Terminal UI" pattern ([MB Log 2025-04-21 18:49:00]). Delegate this task (`new_task` to `code` or `refinement-optimization-mode`).
2.  **Implement Client-Side Validation:** Add input validation within the registration form components to match Zod rules defined server-side.
3.  **Address Local Storage:** Implement basic obfuscation for data stored in local storage or, preferably, minimize the data stored (e.g., only store progress index, fetch sensitive data on load).
4.  **Harmonize Schemas:** Resolve the schema inconsistencies between the registration Zod schema and the DAL/database schema (V2 vs V1.1) to simplify data handling and reduce potential errors. This might involve updating the DAL, the database schema (new migration), or the Zod generation logic.
5.  **Verify `get_my_role()`:** Ensure the `public.get_my_role()` SQL function used in RLS policies securely retrieves the user's role from the `profiles` table based on `auth.uid()` and cannot be manipulated. (Requires DB inspection or reviewing its definition if available in migrations).
6.  **Review Registration Deletion:** Confirm if users should be allowed to delete their own registration via the `deleteRegistration` action and associated RLS policy (`FOR ALL`). If not, change the policy to `FOR SELECT, UPDATE` or restrict the delete action.

## 4. Status

Security review complete based on the defined scope. No critical vulnerabilities found. Recommendations focus on improving maintainability, data handling consistency, and reducing minor risks associated with the registration form's complexity and local storage usage.
